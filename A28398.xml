            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE en≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe contains an Account of the Pre≈øent State of His Maje≈øties Dominions, on the Coa≈øt of <hi>America;</hi> wherein thou wilt find a con≈øiderable Di≈øcovery of the growing Greatne≈øs of tho≈øe di≈øtant Colonies, which, by the mo≈øt clement and wi≈øe Admini≈øtration of the Monarchs of <hi>Great Britan,</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready arrived to a Figure ≈øo Con≈øiderable, as may attract the Emulation of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Potentates; the Golden <hi>Peru</hi> hardly affording ≈øo great a Trea≈øure to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Crown, as the≈øe mo≈øt Flouri≈øhing Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produce to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The va≈øt Returns which the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and other Parts of His Maje≈øties Dominions, make from tho≈øe Parts, are a ≈øufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for any one that would ≈øtudy the Improvement of his Fortunes, to look into the advantages of that Exten≈øive Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb facs="tcp:199140:4"/> which tho≈øe Regions produce. And ≈øince our Neighbours have not been wanting (in the mo≈øt Remote Courts) to repre≈øent their Foreign Plantations as va≈øt and mighty Acce≈ø≈øions to their Government, and to make their State look the more Con≈øiderable in the Eyes of di≈øtant Monarchs: Why may not an E≈ø≈øay towards the Delineation of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Territories in Foreign Parts (at lea≈øt in ≈øome mea≈øure) contribute to rai≈øe in them an E≈øteem and Dread of the Mighty Power of the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Crown. Little more need be ≈øaid to recommend the u≈øefulne≈øs of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuing Di≈øcour≈øe, but that the natural re≈øult of Di≈øcoveries, is the Promotion of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Con≈øiderate know how to make their Advantages thereof.</p>
            <p>There was intended to be added to this Volume, a Summary of the ≈øeveral Laws in Force in each Plantation, but that being a work which will ≈øwell to a larger Bulk than this, is re≈øerved for a particular Treati≈øe by it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>I have one thing more to adverti≈øe thee, That the Printer hath neglected to fix the Running-Title on the top of every Page; therefore thou may'≈øt find that part of the Di≈øcour≈øe which relates to them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Table.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199140:12"/> drive their Ships from Harbour, ca≈øt them on ≈øhore, blow down their Hou≈øes, tear up their Canes, and hurry all into confu≈øion. And had not this <hi>I≈øland</hi> afforded Relief to many of the wracked Inhabitants when they had been thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øed, they mu≈øt in all probability have peri≈øhed. Nor doth any part of this I≈øland unavoidably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitate any of its new Inhabitants to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Di≈øtemper, as <hi>Virginia</hi> and other places do; but if tho≈øe who go thither, will upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, but forbear exce≈øs of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, u≈øe moderate exerci≈øe, and make choice of ≈øuch places for their ≈øettlement, as lie not too low in Vallies, where there comes but little Air; or too near Rivers, where they may peradventure be incommoded with too much moi≈øture, or at the Foot of <hi>Mountains</hi> or <hi>Mora≈ø≈øes,</hi> where probably you may have more Rain than you'l de≈øire; nor by the Sea ≈øide, or upon Bays, where be≈øides the inconvenience of its Sandine≈øs, it will occa≈øion your want of good Water, you will be mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the violent Reflections of the Sun's Beams, which are much fiercer here than in other parts of the I≈øle.</p>
               <p>It hath been ob≈øerved by ≈øome who have lived in the I≈øland, that the Mountains which run along through the mid≈øt of the I≈øle from one extream point to the other, are much cooler than the other parts; in≈øomuch that ≈øometimes in the Morning early there are ≈ømall white Fro≈øts.</p>
               <p>As for the Weather, it is le≈øs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Jamaica</hi> than in the re≈øt of the <hi>Caribby I≈ølands;</hi>

               <p>There is no apparent Winter, only they have ≈øomewhat more Rain and Thunder in the Winter-Months than at other times; nor doth the length of the Days and Nights vary much, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue almo≈øt all the year round of an equal length, <hi>(viz.)</hi> about fifteen hours day: And that which ≈øeems much ≈øtranger, is, the Seas having ≈øeldom been ob≈øerved to ebb or flow above a foot or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; nor hath any Pilot ever yet been able to give a certain account of the Currents of tho≈øe Seas, in regard they are ≈øo various and uncertain; nor could any ever give a rea≈øon why the Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Earthquakes ≈øhould never reach <hi>Jamaica,</hi> although they have ≈øo grievou≈øly afflicted the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent I≈ølands.</p>
               <p>The Rivers of this I≈øland are none of them fair or navigable up into the Country,<note place="margin">Its Road and Harbors.</note> in regard the I≈øland is very mountainous, and their original is for the mo≈øt part in tho≈øe Hills that run through its Center; which running Ea≈øt and We≈øt, the Rivers that ri≈øe in them di≈øembogue them≈øelves North and South, and falling out of tho≈øe high Mountains, are very fierce and rapid in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; being likewi≈øe in regard of the great Rains, ≈øubject to great and ≈øudden Inundations; at which times they fall with ≈øuch fury, that great Stone-Rocks and large pieces of Timber are born down,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199140:13"/> and carried along by the violence of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which makes their u≈øual pa≈ø≈øage ≈øo foul and trouble≈øom, that they are thereby rendred alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unpa≈ø≈øable by Boats and other ≈ømall Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels. Be≈øides which, there are divers of them which at ≈øome times have not one drop of Water in them, but are wholly dried up, which renders them likewi≈øe u≈øele≈øs for Navigation; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of <hi>Minoa,</hi> that runs through <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which ≈øometimes hath not a drop of Water, and yet at other Sea≈øons hath as much as the River of <hi>Thames</hi> at high-water: But although the Rivers are thus u≈øele≈øs, yet towards the Sea the I≈øland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with great plenty of very good Bays, Roads and Harbours; the principal whereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Port-Royal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Port-Royal.</note> which at it fir≈øt ≈øetling by the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> ≈øoon after they took the I≈øland from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> received the Name of <hi>Cagway,</hi> but when the Town began to encrea≈øe, and draw towards its perfection, it obtained in Sir <hi>Charles Littleton</hi>'s time the Name of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its Harbour. It is ≈øituated on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream end of that long point of Land that makes the Harbour, running about twelve Miles from the Main We≈øterly, having the Sea on its South, and the Harbour on the North; which Harbour is ≈øo exceeding ≈øafe and commodious for Shipping, that they are ≈øecure in all Weathers, and can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade them≈øelves afloat at the Merchants-Key; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewi≈øe during their Riding there, ≈øecured from any Attempts that might be made on them by an Enemy, by one of the ≈øtronge≈øt and mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable Ca≈øtles that His Maje≈øty hath in all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> which is well garri≈øonn'd with Souldiers, and hath above ≈øixty Pieces of Cannon mounted in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199140:13"/> it. Be≈øides which, it is Land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs Twelve Miles <hi>South-East</hi> from the Main of the I≈øland, and hath the great River which runs by <hi>Los-Angelos</hi> and St. <hi>Jago</hi> (where Ships that trade to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> commonly water, and provide them≈øelves with what Wood they want for their Voyage back) falling into it. The Harbour is about three Leagues broad in mo≈øt places, and is ≈øo deep, that a Ship of a Thou≈øand Tun may lay her ≈øides to the Shoar of the Point, and load and unload at plea≈øure; nor doth there want good Anchorage in any part of it. This Harbour being ≈øo exceeding ≈øafe and commodious, is the rea≈øon why it is frequented both by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships and Men of War more than any other Port in that I≈øland.</p>
               <p>The Point of Land whereon the Town is built, is exceeding narrow, and nothing but a loo≈øe Sand, ≈øo that it affords neither <hi>Gra≈øs, Stone, fre≈øh Water, Trees,</hi> nor any thing el≈øe which could encourage the building a Town upon it, be≈øides the goodne≈øs of the Harbour.

               <p>When a per≈øon, who intends to ≈øettle at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> arrives,<note place="margin">Of a Cocao Walk.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath taken a view of the Country, his fir≈øt work mu≈øt be to take up Six hundred Acres of Land, which mu≈øt be cho≈øen in a good place, that ≈øo the Land may be proper to produce the Nut; which Grant, for the Patent and Surveying, will co≈øt Ten Pounds. Having taken up his Land, he mu≈øt provide him≈øelf of three <hi>Negro</hi> Men, and as many Women; which, at Twenty Pounds <hi>per</hi> head, will come to an Hundred and twenty Pounds; with four White Servants, which, with their Pa≈ø≈øage and Diet for a Year, will co≈øt him about Eighty Pounds; with Twenty Axes, and the like number of Bills and Hoes, which will co≈øt him about Five Pounds; and with an Over≈øeer, to look after his Servants and keep them to their work, who≈øe Wages and Diet, at Forty Shillings a Month, will co≈øt him Twenty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199140:19"/> four Pounds: All which, with Eighteen Pounds, which the Provi≈øions for his Six <hi>Negro</hi> Servants, will, at Four Pence <hi>per</hi> day, each of them co≈øt him for the fir≈øt ≈øix Months, till his own Plantation is capable of maintaining them, is Two hundred fifty ≈øeven Pounds, Five Shillings.</p>
               <p>When this is done, his next bu≈øine≈øs is to ≈øet his Servants to work, who≈øe fir≈øt imployment mu≈øt be to cut down the Wood, and clear a convenient place, whereon to build fitting Hou≈øes for their Lodging; which, if they begin with <hi>March,</hi> they will have effected by the middle of that Month: After which, he mu≈øt ≈øet them to felling the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, grubbing up the Roots, and clearing a piece of Ground, of four Acres, whereon to plant <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes;</hi> all which planting, and all, with the help of his Servants, will be ea≈øily effected by the middle of <hi>April.</hi> And then his be≈øt way is to ≈øet them to prepare more Ground, which he may plant with <hi>Plantane</hi>-Trees, and other things, (which he thinks he ≈øhall fir≈øt want, for the enabling his Plantation to ≈øub≈øi≈øt of its ≈øelf) till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February,</hi> which compleats the Year. In which time they may, with ea≈øe, prepare and plant about one or two and twenty Acres, and the Plantation will be able to live of its ≈øelf, for they will now be full of <hi>Potatoes</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> and within two Months of the new Year with <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> which, together with his ≈øtock of Hoggs and Fowls will ≈øufficiently furni≈øh him with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for his Servants.</p>
               <p>To improve this Ground, and plant the <hi>Cacao-Walk,</hi> he mu≈øt, about the beginning of the next <hi>March,</hi> provide him≈øelf with five <hi>Negro</hi> men more, and as many Women, which will come to Two hundred pounds more: And that Month he mu≈øt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199140:19"/> imploy all the hands he has in planting <hi>Cacao</hi>-Trees between all the Rows of <hi>Plantanes,</hi> which, by this time are grown to be ≈øix foot high, and, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June,</hi> he will have, be≈øides much other work done, the whole twenty one Acres, which were planted the year before with <hi>Cacao</hi>-Trees, which, in le≈øs than four years, will begin to bear Cods, and, in five years, produce compleat Crops, each Acre affording yearly to the Planter a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Weight of <hi>Cacao</hi>-Nuts, which is there worth about four Pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> ≈øo that the twenty one Acres, which are already planted and come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, are worth Eight hundred and forty Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> And the whole Expence, together with Forty two Pounds fifteen Shillings more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for gathering and hou≈øing them, amounts but to Five hundred Pounds, ≈øo that the profit will be very con≈øiderable.</p>
               <p>All the Work, already mentioned, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in fifteen Months, and the remaining time, till the <hi>Cacaoes</hi> come to perfection, which will be ≈øomewhat better than four year, he may imploy in increa≈øing the Walk, building convenient Hou≈øes, and making of Gardens for plea≈øure: Or, if the ≈ømalne≈øs of his Stock will not permit him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his Money till the <hi>Cacaoes</hi> come to bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, he may fall to planting <hi>Ginger, Indico,</hi> or ≈øome ≈øuch kind of Commodity for pre≈øent profit.</p>
               <p>And according to this Calculation the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ≈ømaller or a larger Walk may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

               <p>Having made this Di≈øcovery, and informed him≈øelf as well as he could of the Nature and Condition of the I≈øland, he gave notice thereof

               <p>This I≈øle is very hot, e≈øpecially for eight Months,<note place="margin">Its Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and would be more in≈øupportable, were it not for the cool Briezes of Wind, which ri≈øe with the Sun, and blow fre≈øher as the Sun mounteth higher.

               <p>The Lodging of the≈øe poor Wretches is wor≈øt of all; for having laboured all the day in ≈øo hot a Country, without any nouri≈øhing Diet, at night they mu≈øt be content to lie hard, on nothing but a Board, without any Coverlet, in their Huts or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hog-≈øties; but Chri≈øtian Servants are ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better treated, being allowed Hamocks.</p>

               <p>The Servants, after five years, become Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the I≈øland, and then employ their time as may be mo≈øt to their Advantage; but the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro-Slaves</hi> and their Children being in bondage for ever, are pre≈øerved with greater care, and u≈øed with ≈øuch ≈øeverity, as occa≈øioned a great con≈øpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy again≈øt their Ma≈øters ≈øome years ≈øince; which was ≈øo clo≈øely carried, as no di≈øcovery was made till the day before it was to be acted, and then one of them, either failing of his Courage, or out of Love to his Ma≈øter, di≈øcovered and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; for which, many of them were put to death, as a Terror to the re≈øt; who being ≈øo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, might prove dangerous, but that they are kept in ≈øuch ≈øtrict aw, and not ≈øuffered to touch or handle a Weapon; ≈øo that nothing is more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them than Gun-≈øhot; and be≈øides, being of different Countries, do not under≈øtand one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Language; for in ≈øome of tho≈øe places in <hi>Africa,</hi> where petty Kingdoms are, who go to War again≈øt one another, the Pri≈øoners that are taken on each ≈øide, they ≈øell unto and other <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Nations that come to traffick with them; yea, they ≈øell their Subjects, and ≈øome poor men their Servants, and ≈øometimes their Wives, for ≈øuch Traffick as our Merchants bring them; when they are brought hither, the Planters buy them

               <p>The Soyl<note place="margin">The Soyl.</note> being light and ≈øandy, is apt to produce all ≈øorts of the Country-Fruits, Provi≈øion and Commodities, as <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Ginger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>There is on the Sea-≈øide a Salt-Pit, called <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øac;</hi> and not far from the Salt-Pit there is a ≈ømall <hi>I≈øthmus</hi> of Land, which reacheth within a Mile and a half of the I≈øland of <hi>Nevis</hi> and <hi>Mevis.</hi>

               <p>The I≈øland is placed exceeding delightful, and of a mo≈øt delectable pro≈øpect to the eye of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, for it is divided into ≈øeveral ≈øtages, from the uppermo≈øt whereof a man may take an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plea≈øant pro≈øpect of all the Plantations and Gardens, which gently de≈øcend to the Sea-≈øide, and in regard of the general a≈øcent of the I≈øle, the lower ≈øtage or ≈øtory doth not debar the eye of the plea≈øant pro≈øpect of that which lieth at a remoter di≈øtance; and that which makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect the more delectable in the ≈øeveral Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (which are bounded with Rows of Trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their verdure) are the fair Hou≈øes covered with glazed Slate.</p>

It may be counted a ≈øort of <hi>Camelion,</hi> partaking of the colour of tho≈øe things on which it makes its ordinary re≈øidence, for being about Palm-Trees, it is green, and about Orange-Trees, yellow, and the like.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Flamot</hi> is an exceeding large and beautiful Bird, about the bigne≈øs of a wild Goo≈øe; his Beak is like a Spoon, his Legs and Neck very long, ≈øo that his Body is three foot from the ground, their Feathers being white when they are young, after Murrey, and when they come to be old, of a bright Carnation, being rarely ≈øeen but in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and their hearing and ≈ømelling is ≈øo perfect, that they ≈ømell the Hunt≈ømen and Fire-arms at a large di≈øtance, and therefore, for fear of ≈øurprize, they make their aboad in the mid≈øt of the Fens, one of them being always Continel while they are ≈øearching about the waters for a livelihood; as ≈øoon as he hears the lea≈øt noi≈øe, or ≈øees a man, he takes his flight, and makes a great cry, for a ≈øignal to the re≈øt to follow him: when the Hunt≈ømen take them, they get the wind of them, that they may not ≈ømell the Powder, and covering them≈øelves with an Ox-hide, creep on their hands and feet 'till they get ≈øuch an opportunity that they are ≈øure of killing them.</p>

The <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> have here ≈øome ≈øettlement, but are not very powerful, it being more populous of <hi>Caribeans,</hi> than of any po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by them, who have here many fair Villages, where they dwell exceeding plea≈øant, without the lea≈øt di≈øturbance; and though they are jealous of tho≈øe Strangers that live near them, and keep Guard when they come upon their Roads, yet they do not deny <hi>Ca≈ø≈øavy</hi> Bread, Water, Fruits, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions growing in their Country, to them that want them, taking in exchange Wedges, Hooks, and other Implements of Iron, which they much e≈øteem.

               </p>
               <p>Some time ≈øince, mo≈øt of the <hi>Caribeans</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded, that Gun-powder was the Seed of ≈øome Hearb, in≈øomuch that ≈øome of them ≈øowed it in their Gardens.

To invocate them to carry away their Great Devil, or <hi>Maboya,</hi> for they never pray to him: His Invocation is by Singing ≈øome words, and burning Tobacco, the ≈øcent whereof is ≈øo plea≈øant, that it makes this little Devil appear. And when their ≈øeveral Prie≈øts call upon their ≈øeveral Gods together, as they ≈øpeak, the≈øe Gods, or rather Devils, rail, quarrel, and ≈øeem to fight with each other. The≈øe Daemons ≈øhelter them≈øelves ≈øometimes in the Bones of dead Men, taken out of the Graves, and wrapt in Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and thereby give Oracles, ≈øaying, it is the Soul of the decea≈øed Per≈øon; they make u≈øe of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerers wrapping up the≈øe Bones with ≈øomething that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The≈øe Devils do al≈øo ≈øometimes enter into the Bodies of Women, and ≈øpeak by them, clearly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwering all que≈øtions demanded: After the Boy or Prie≈øt is retir'd, the Devil ≈øtirs the Ve≈ø≈øels, and makes a noi≈øe with his Jaws, as if he were eating and drinking the Pre≈øents prepared for him, but the next day they find he hath not medled with any thing.

If any of their Enemies die on the place of Battel, they eat them there; they de≈øign only for Slavery the young Maids and Women taken in War; they have ta≈øted of all the Nations that frequent them, and upon experience affirm, that the <hi>French</hi> are the mo≈øt tender, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the harde≈øt of dige≈øtion; but now they feed on no Chri≈øtians at all.</p>
               <p>They ab≈øtain from ≈øeveral Cruelties formerly u≈øed before they killed their Enemies, for now they think it enough to di≈øpatch them at a blow or two with a Club, and afterwards cut them into pieces, and having boyl'd them, they devour them: They heretofore put them to ≈øeveral torments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave them the mortal blow, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Relation they them≈øelves have given to tho≈øe who have been curious, from their own mouths.

               <p>The Great Soul of our <hi>Arovagues</hi> was not only in his Lips, but likewi≈øe ≈øhewed it al≈øo in the effects which follow his Bravado; for after the Company had a while endured his arrogant defiance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p>The conveniency of Situation, temperature of Air, and fertility of Soyl is ≈øuch, that there is no le≈øs then ≈øeven con≈øiderable Towns, <hi>viz. Shrewsbury,</hi>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>For this Province, the general Condition of it take as followeth:</head>
                  <p>THE Country it≈øelf in its Soil, Air, Water, Sea≈øons, and Product, both Natural and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, is not to be de≈øpi≈øed.</p>
                  <p>The Land contains divers ≈øorts of Earth; as Sand, yellow and black,<note place="margin">Its Soil.</note> poor and rich: Al≈øo Gravel, both loomy and du≈øty; and in ≈øome places a fa≈øt, fat Earth, like to our be≈øt Vales in <hi>England,</hi> e≈øpecially by Inland-Brooks and Rivers; God, in his wi≈ødom, hath ordered it ≈øo, that the Advantages of the Country are divided, the Back-Lands being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally three to one richer than tho≈øe that lye by Navigable Waters; we have much of another Soil, and that is a black, Ha≈øle-Mould, upon a ≈øtony or rocky bottom.</p>
                  <p>The Air<note place="margin">Its Air.</note> is ≈øweet and cleer, the Heavens ≈øerene, like the South-Parts of <hi>France,</hi> rarely over-ca≈øt, and as the Woods come by numbers of people to be more cleared, that it≈øelf will refine.</p>
                  <p>The Waters<note place="margin">Its Waters.</note> are generally good, for the Rivers and Brooks have mo≈øtly gravel and ≈øtony bottoms, and in number hardly credible. We have al≈øo Mineral Waters, that operate in the ≈øame manner with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:199140:57"/> and <hi>North-hall,</hi> not two Miles from <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Sea≈øons of the Year, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,<note place="margin">Its Climate.</note> by God's goodne≈øs, now lived over the colde≈øt and hotte≈øt, that the olde≈øt liver in the Province can remember, I can ≈øay ≈øomething to an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> under≈øtanding. Fir≈øt, Of the Fall, for then I came in: I found it from the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> as we have it u≈øually in <hi>September,</hi> or rather like an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> mild Spring. From <hi>December,</hi> to the beginning of the Month called <hi>March,</hi> we had ≈øharp, fro≈øty weather; not foul, thick, black weather, as our North-Ea≈øt Winds bring with them in <hi>England,</hi> but a Sky as clear as in Summer, and the Air dry, cold, piercing, and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more Clothes than in <hi>England.</hi> The rea≈øon of this cold is given from the great Lakes that are fed by the Fountains of <hi>Canada.</hi> The Winter before was as mild, ≈øcarce any Ice at all; while this for a few days froze up our great River <hi>Delaware.</hi> From that Month, to the Month called <hi>June,</hi> we enjoyed a ≈øweet Spring, no Gu≈øts, but gentle Showers and a fine Sky. Yet this I ob≈øerve, that the Winds here, as there, are mo≈øt incon≈øtant Spring and Fall, upon that turn of Nature, than in Summer or Winter. From thence, to this pre≈øent Month, which ended the Summer, (commonly ≈øpeaking) we have had extraordinary heats, yet mitigated ≈øometimes by cold Breezes. The Wind that rules the Summer-≈øea≈øon, is the South-We≈øt; but Spring, Fall, and Winter, 'tis rare to want the whole≈øom North-We≈øtern ≈øeven days together; and whatever Mi≈øts, Fogs, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, foul the Heavens by Ea≈øterly or Southerly Winds, in two hours time are blown away; the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199140:57"/> one is always followed by the other. A Remedy that ≈øeems to be a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of Trees yet ≈øtanding, being liable to retain Mi≈øts and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and yet not one quarter ≈øo thick as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>The natural product of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vegetables.</note> is Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers; the Trees of mo≈øt Note, are, the Black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Che≈ønut, Poplar, Gum-wood, Hickery, Sa≈ø≈øafras, A≈øh, Beech, and Oak of divers ≈øorts, as Red, White and Black; <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Che≈ønut and Swamp, the mo≈øt durable of all; of all which there is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for u≈øe of Man.</p>
                  <p>The Fruits<note place="margin">Fruits.</note> that I find in the Woods, are, the white and black Mulberry, Che≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Walnut, Plums, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries, and Grapes of divers ≈øorts, the great red Grape, (now Ripe) called by ignorance, the <hi>Fox</hi>-Grape (becau≈øe of the reli≈øh it hath with unskilful palates) is in it ≈øelf an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Grape, and by art doubtle≈øs may be cultivated to an excellent Wine, if not ≈øo ≈øweet, yet little inferiour to the <hi>Frontiniack,</hi> as it is not much unlike in ta≈øte, ruddine≈øs ≈øet a≈øide, which in ≈øuch things, as well as Mankind, differs the ca≈øe much. There is a white kind of Muskadel, and a little black Grape, like the clu≈øter of Grapes in <hi>England,</hi> not yet ≈øo ripe as the other, but they tell me when ripe, ≈øweeter, and that they only want skilful <hi>Vinerons</hi> to make good u≈øe of them; <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to venture on it with my</hi> French-<hi>Man this Sea≈øon, who ≈øhews ≈øome knowledge in tho≈øe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are al≈øo Peaches, very good, and in great quantities, not an <hi>Indian</hi> Plantation without them;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199140:58"/> but whether naturally here at fir≈øt, I know not, however one may have them by Bu≈øhels for little; they make a plea≈øant Drink, and I think not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to any Peach you have in <hi>England,</hi> except the true <hi>Newington.</hi> 'Tis di≈øputable with me, whether it be be≈øt to fall to Fining the Fruits of the Country, e≈øpecially the Grapes, by the care and skill of Art, or ≈øend for Forreign Stems and Sets already good and approved; it ≈øeems mo≈øt rea≈øonable to believe, that not only a thing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth be≈øt, where it naturally grows; but will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be equall'd by another's Species of the ≈øame kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to re≈øolve this doubt, I intend (if God give me life) to try both, and hope the Con≈øequences will be as good Wine as any <hi>European</hi> Countries of the ≈øame Latitude do yield.</p>
                  <p>The artificial Product<note place="margin">Its Product.</note> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Pea≈øe, Beans, Squa≈øhes, Pumkins, Water-Melons, Musk-Melons, and all Herbs and Roots that our Gardens in <hi>England</hi> u≈øually bring forth.</p>
                  <p>Of Living Creatures,<note place="margin">Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> as Fi≈øh, Fowl, and the Bea≈øt of the Woods, here are divers ≈øorts, ≈øome for Food and Profit, and ≈øome for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit only; for food as well as profit, the Elk, as big as a ≈ømall Ox, Deer bigger than ours, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Racoon, Rabbits, Squirrils, and ≈øome eat young Bear, and commend it. Of Fowls of the Land, there is the Turkey, (forty or fifty pound weight) which is very great; Phea≈øants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons, and Patridges in abundance: Of the Water, the Swan, Goo≈øe, white and gray, Ducks, Teal, al≈øo the Snipe and Curloe, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199140:58"/> that in great numbers; but the Duck and Teal excel, nor ≈øo good have I ever eat in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Of Fi≈øh, there is the Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Cat≈øhead, Eel, Smelt, Pearch, Roch; and in Inland Rivers, Trout, ≈øome ≈øay Salmon, above the Falls. Of Shell-fi≈øh, we have Oy≈øters, Crabs, Cockles, Concks, Mu≈øeta's; ≈øome Oy≈øters ≈øix Inches long,; and one ≈øort of Cockles, as big as the ≈øtewing Oy≈øter; they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for profit only, by Skin or Furr, and that are natural to tho≈øe Parts, are the Wild-Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fi≈øher, Minx, Musk-Rat: And of the Water, the Whale for Oyl, of which we have good ≈øtore; and two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Whalers, who≈øe Boats are built, will ≈øoon begin their work, which hath the appearance of a con≈øiderable improvement to nothing of our rea≈øonable hopes, of good Cod in the Bay. We have no want of Hor≈øes, and ≈øome are very good, &amp; ≈øhapely enough; two Ships have been fraighted to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with Hor≈øes and Pipe-≈øtaves, ≈øince my coming in; here is al≈øo plenty of Cow-Cattel, and ≈øome Sheep; the People Plow mo≈øtly with Oxen.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Plants,<note place="margin">Plants.</note> that not only the <hi>Indians</hi> tell us, but we have had occa≈øion to prove, by Swellings, Burns, Cuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they are of great virtue, ≈øuddenly curing the Patient; and for ≈ømell, I have ob≈øerved ≈øeveral, e≈øpecially one, the wild Mirtle; the other I know not what to call, but are mo≈øt fragrant; the Woods are adorned with love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers, for colour, greatne≈øs, figure and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; I have ≈øeen the Gardens of <hi>London</hi> be≈øt ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that ≈øort of beauty, but think they may be improved by our Woods; I have ≈øent a few to a Per≈øon of Quality this year for a Tryal.

The Children will go very young, at nine Months com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; they wear only a ≈ømall Clout round their Wai≈øt till they are big; if Boys, they go a Fi≈øhing till ripe for the Woods, which is about fifteen; then they Hunt, and having given ≈øome proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of Skins, they may Marry, el≈øe it is ≈øhame to think of a Wife. The Girls ≈øtay with their Mothers, and help to Hoe the Ground, Plant Corn, and carry Burthens; and they do well to u≈øe them to that Young, which they mu≈øt do when they are Old; for the Wives are the true Servants of their Husbands; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the Men are very affectionate to them. When the young Women are fit for Marriage, they wear ≈øomething upon their Heads for an Adverti≈øement,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199140:60"/> but ≈øo as their Faces are hardly to be ≈øeen, but when they plea≈øe: The Age they Marry at, if Women, is about thirteen and fourteen; if Men, ≈øeventeen and eighteen; they are rarely elder: their Hou≈øes are Mats, or Barks of Trees, ≈øet on Poles, in the fa≈øhion of an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Barn, but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a man; they lie on Reeds or Gra≈øs. In travel they lodge in the Woods about a great fire, with the Mantle-Duffils they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs ≈øtuck round them. Their Diet is <hi>Maiz</hi> or <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> divers ways prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; ≈øometimes roa≈øted in the A≈øhes, ≈øometimes beaten and boiled with Water, which they call <hi>Homine;</hi> they al≈øo make Cakes, not unplea≈øant to eat; they have likewi≈øe ≈øeveral ≈øorts of <hi>Beans</hi> and <hi>Pea≈øe,</hi> that are good nouri≈øhment; and the Woods and Rivers are their Larder.</p>

Their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip con≈øi≈øts of two parts, Sacrifice and Cantico: Their Sacrifice is their fir≈øt Fruits, the fir≈øt and fatte≈øt Buck they kill, goes to the Fire, where he is all burnt with a mournful Ditty of him that performs the Ceremony, but with ≈øuch marvellous fervency and labour of Body, that he will even ≈øweat to a Foam; the other part of their Cantico, is performed by round Dances, ≈øometimes Words, ≈øometimes Songs, then Shouts; two being in the middle that begin, and by ≈øinging and drumming on a Board, direct the Chorus; their Po≈øtures in the Dance are very antick and differing, but all keep mea≈øure. This is done with equal earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and labour, but great appearance of Joy.

                  <p>Their Government<note place="margin">Government.</note> is by Kings which they call <hi>Sachema,</hi> and tho≈øe by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, but always of the Mothers-≈øide; for in≈øtance, the Children of him that is now King, will not ≈øucceed, but his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Mother, or the Children of his Si≈øter, who≈øe Sons (and after them the Children of her Daughters) will reign; for no Woman inherits: the Rea≈øon they render for this way of De≈øcent, is, that their I≈ø≈øue may not be ≈øpurious. Every King hath his Council, and that con≈øi≈øts of all the old and wi≈øe men of his Nation, which perhaps is two hundred People: Nothing of moment is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, be it War, Peace, ≈øelling of Land, Traffick, without advi≈øing with them; and which is more, with the young men too. 'Tis admirable to con≈øider how powerful the Kings are, and how they move by the Breath of the People. I have had occa≈øion to be in Council with them upon Treaties of Land, and to adju≈øt the Terms of Trade: Their Order is thus; The King ≈øits in the middle of a half-Moon, and hath his Council, the old and wi≈øe on each hand; behind them, or at a little di≈øtance, ≈øit the younger Fry in the ≈øame Figure; having con≈øulted and re≈øolved their Bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs, the King ordered one of them to ≈øpeak to me, and he in the Name of his King ≈øaluted me; then took me by the hand, and told me, That he was ordered by his King to ≈øpeak to me; and that now it was not he, but the King that ≈øpoke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199140:62"/> what he ≈øhould ≈øay, was the King's Mind. He fir≈øt prayed me to excu≈øe them that they had not complied with me the la≈øt time, he feared there might be ≈øome fault in the Interpreter, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Indian</hi> nor <hi>Engli≈øh;</hi> be≈øides it was the <hi>Indian</hi> cu≈øtom to deliberate, and take up much time in Council before they re≈øolve; and that if the young People and Owners of the Land had been as ready as he, I had not met with ≈øo much delay. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus introduced this Matter, he fell to the Bounds of the Land they had agreed to di≈øpo≈øe of, and the Price (which now is little and dear, that which would have bought twenty Miles, not buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now two.) During the time that this Per≈øon ≈øpoke, not a man of them was ob≈øerved to whi≈øper or ≈ømile; the Old grave, the Young reverent in their deportment: They do ≈øpeak little, but fervently and with elegancy; I have never ≈øeen more natural ≈øagacity, con≈øidering them without the help of Tradition; and he will de≈øerve the Name of wi≈øe, that out-wits them in any Treaty about a thing they under≈øtand.</p>
                  <p>When the Purcha≈øe was agreed, great Promi≈øes pa≈ø≈øed between us of Kindne≈øs and good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> mu≈øt live in Love as long as the Sun gave Light; which done, another made a Speech to the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Name of all the <hi>Sachamakers</hi> or Kings, fir≈øt to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them to love <hi>Chri≈øtians;</hi> and particularly to live in peace with me, and the People under my Government: That many Governors had been in the River, but that no Governor had come him≈øelf to live and ≈øtay here before; and having now ≈øuch a one that had treated them well, they ≈øhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do him or his any wrong.

                  <p>The Ju≈øtice<note place="margin">Their Ju≈øtice.</note> they have is pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary; in ca≈øe of any wrong or evil fact, be it Murder it≈øelf, they atone by Fea≈øts and Pre≈øents of their <hi>Wampum,</hi> which is proportioned to the quality of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or Per≈øon injur'd, of the Sex they are of: For in ca≈øe they kill a Woman, they pay double; and the rea≈øon they render, is, That ≈øhe breedeth Children, which men cannot do. 'Tis rare that they fall out, if ≈øober; and if drunk, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it; ≈øaying, it was the Drink, and not the Man, that abu≈øed them. We have agreed, that in all differences between us, ≈øix of each ≈øide ≈øhall end the Matter.

I be≈øeech God to encline the hearts of all that come into the≈øe parts, to out-live the Knowledge of the Natives, by a fixt obedience to their greater Knowledge of the Will of God; for it were mi≈øerable indeed for us to fall under the ju≈øt cen≈øure of the poor <hi>Indian</hi> Con≈øcience, while we make profe≈ø≈øion of things ≈øo far tran≈øcending.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Philadelphia.</note> the Expectation of tho≈øe that are concerned in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is at la≈øt laid out to the great content of tho≈øe here that are any ways intere≈ø≈øed therein: The Situation is a Neck of Land, and lieth between two navigable Rivers, <hi>Delaware</hi> and <hi>Skulkil,</hi> whereby it hath two Fronts upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, each a Mile, and two from River to River. <hi>Delaware</hi> is a glorious River, but the <hi>Skulkil</hi> being an hundred Miles Boatable above the Falls, and its Cour≈øe North-Ea≈øt towards the Fountain of <hi>Su≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qitahannah</hi> (that tends to the heart of the Province, and both ≈øides our own) it is like to be a great part of the Settlement of this Age, in which tho≈øe that are Purcha≈øers of me, will find their Names and Intere≈øt. But this I will ≈øay for the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, That of all the many Places I have ≈øeen in the world, I remember not one better ≈øeated; ≈øo that it ≈øeems to me, to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointned for a Town, whether we regard the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or the conveniency of the <hi>Coves, Docks, Springs,</hi> the loftine≈øs and ≈øoundne≈øs of the Land and the Ayr, held by the People of tho≈øe Parts, to be very good. It is advanced within le≈øs than a Year to about four≈øcore Hou≈øes and Cottages, ≈øuch as they are; where Merchants and Handicraft≈ømen are following their Vocations as fa≈øt as they can, while the Countrey-men are clo≈øe in their Farms: Some of them got a little Winter-Corn in the Ground la≈øt Sea≈øon, and the generality have had
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199140:65"/> a hand≈øom Summer-Crop, and are preparing for their Winter-Corn. They reaped their <hi>Barley</hi> this Year in the Month called <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> in the Month following; ≈øo that there is time in the≈øe parts for another Crop of divers things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Winter-Sea≈øon. We are dayly in hopes of Shipping to add to our Number; for ble≈ø≈øed be God there is both room and accommodation for them; the Stories of our Nece≈ø≈øity being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fear of our Friends, or the Scare-crows of our Enemies; for the greate≈øt hard≈øhip we have ≈øuffered hath been <hi>Salt-Meat,</hi> which by <hi>Fowl</hi> in Winter, and <hi>Fi≈øh</hi> in Summer, together with ≈øome <hi>Poultry, Lamb, Mutton, Veal,</hi> and plenty of <hi>Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon</hi> the be≈øt part of the Year, hath been very pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øable I ble≈øs God, I am fully ≈øatisfied with the Country and Entertainment I can get in it; for I find that particular content which hath always attended me, where God by his Providence hath made it my Place and Service to re≈øide. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, my Station can be at pre≈øent free of more than ordinary an ordinary Bu≈øine≈øs; and as ≈øuch, I may ≈øay it is a trouble≈øom Work; but the Method things are putting in, will facilitate the Charge, and give an ea≈øier motion to the Admini≈øtration of Affairs. However, as it is ≈øome mens Duty to plow, ≈øome to ≈øow, ≈øome to water, and ≈øome to reap, ≈øo it is the Wi≈ødonm, as well as Duty of a man, to yield to the Mind of Providence, and chearfully, as well as carefully, embrace and follow the Guidance of it.</p>

                  <head>Of Provi≈øion in general.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. It has been often ≈øaid, we are ≈øtarved for want of Food;<note place="margin">Provi≈øion.</note> ≈øome were apt to ≈øuge≈øt their Fears, others to in≈øinuate their Prejudice, and when this was contracted, and they a≈ø≈øured we had plenty, both of Bread, Fi≈øh and Fle≈øh, then 'twas objected, we were forced to fetch it from other places at great Charges: But neither is all this true, though all the World will, think we mu≈øt either bring Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion with us, or get it of the Neighbourhood till we had gotten hou≈øes over our heads, and a little Land in tillage. We fetched none, nor were we wholly kept by Neighbours; the old Inhabitants ≈øupplied us with mo≈øt of the Corn we wanted, and a good ≈øhare of Pork and Beef: 'Tis true, <hi>New-York, New-England,</hi> and <hi>Road-I≈øland,</hi> did with their Provi≈øions fetch our Goods and Money, but at ≈øuch Rates, that ≈øome ≈øold for almo≈øt what they gave, and others carried their Provi≈øions back, expecting a better Market nearer; which ≈øhewed no ≈øcarcity, and that we were not totally de≈øtitute in our own River. But if my Advice be of any value, I would have them buy ≈øtill, and not weaken their Herds, by killing up their young Stock too ≈øoon.</p>
                  <p>But the right mea≈øure of Information mu≈øt be the proportion of value of Provi≈øion there, to what they are in more planted and mature Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. <hi>Beef</hi> is commonly ≈øold at the rate of two pence <hi>per</hi> pound; and <hi>Pork</hi> for two pence halfpeny, <hi>Veal</hi> and <hi>Mutton</hi> at three pence, or three pence halfpeny of that Countrey Money; an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Shilling goes for Sixteen pence. Grain ≈øells by the Bu≈øhel; <hi>Wheat</hi> at four ≈øhillings, <hi>Rye,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199140:71"/> good, at three ≈øhillings; <hi>Barley,</hi> two ≈øhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ≈øix pence, <hi>Indian Corn</hi> two ≈øhillings ≈øix pence, <hi>Oats,</hi> two ≈øhillings, in that Money ≈øtill, which in a new Countrey, where Grain is ≈øo much wanted for Seed, as well as Food, cannot be called dear; and e≈øpecially if we con≈øider the con≈øumption of the many new Comers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is ≈øo great an encrea≈øe of Grain, by the diligent application of People to Husbandry, that within three years, ≈øome Plantations have got twenty Acres in Corn, ≈øome forty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are very careful to increa≈øe their Stock, and get into Dairies as fa≈øt as they can. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready make good Butter and Chee≈øe. A good Cow and a Calf by her ≈øide, may be worth three pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> in Goods at fir≈øt co≈øt. A pair of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oxen eight pound, a pair of fat ones little more, and a plain breeding Mare about five pounds <hi>≈øterling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. For <hi>Fi≈øh,</hi> it is brought to the door, both fre≈øh and ≈øalt, ≈øix <hi>Alloes</hi> or <hi>Rocks</hi> for twelve pence, and ≈øalt-fi≈øh at three farthings <hi>per</hi> pound, <hi>Oy≈øters</hi> at two ≈øhillings <hi>per</hi> Bu≈øhel.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our <hi>Drink</hi> has been <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Punch,</hi> made of <hi>Rum</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> Our Beer was mo≈øtly made of <hi>Molo≈ø≈øes,</hi> which well boyled with <hi>Sa≈ø≈øafras</hi> or <hi>Pine,</hi> infu≈øed into it, makes very tolerable Drink; but now they make Malt, and Malt-Drink begins to be common, e≈øpecially at Ordinaries, and the hou≈øes of the more ≈øub≈øtantial people. In our great Town there is an able man that has ≈øet up a Brew-hou≈øe in order to furni≈øh the people with good Drink, both there and up and down the River.</p>

                        <p>HAving an opportunity by a Ship from this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (out of which ≈øeveral have gone this year) I thought fit to give a ≈øhort account of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as to Settlement here, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in Town and Countrey: As to the Countrey, the Improvements are large, and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements very much thronged, by way of Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip and Villages, great inclination to planting Orchards, which are ea≈øily rai≈øed, and ≈øome brought to perfection, much Hay-≈øeed ≈øown, and much planting of Corn this year, and great product ≈øaid to be, both of <hi>Wheat, Rye</hi> and <hi>Rice; Barly</hi> and <hi>Oats</hi> prove very well; be≈øides <hi>Indian Corn</hi> and <hi>Pea≈øe</hi> of ≈øeveral ≈øorts; al≈øo <hi>Kidney-Beans,</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh Pea≈øe</hi> of ≈øeveral kinds, I have had in my own Ground, with <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Roots, <hi>Turnips, Par≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, Carrots, Onions, Leeks, Radi≈øhes</hi> and <hi>Cabbages,</hi> with abundance of Herbs and Flowers: I know but of few Seeds that have mi≈øs'd, except <hi>Ro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Seed,</hi> which being <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> might be old. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo I have ≈øuch plenty of <hi>Pumkins, Musk-Melons, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Melons, Squa≈øhes, Co≈øhaws, Bucks-hens, Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and <hi>Simnels</hi> of divers ≈øorts, admired at by new comers, that the Earth ≈øhould ≈øo plentifully ca≈øt forth, e≈øpecially the fir≈øt years breaking up, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199140:72"/> on that which is counted the wor≈øt ≈øort of Sandy Land.

Fir≈øt, I burned the Leaves, then had it grubb'd, not the Fields, but the ≈ømall Roots up, then ≈øow'd great and ≈ømall <hi>Clovers,</hi> with a little old Gra≈øs-Seed, and had it only raked over, not plowed nor harrowed, and it grows exceedingly: Al≈øo, for Experience, I ≈øowed ≈øome Patches of the ≈øame ≈øort in my Garden, and dunged ≈øome, and that grows wor≈øt; I have planted the <hi>Iri≈øh Potatoes,</hi> and hope to have a brave encrea≈øe to tran≈øplant next year.

                        <p>Now as to the Town of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it goes on in Planting and Building to admiration, both in the Front and backward, and there are about 600 Hou≈øes in three years time; and ≈øince I built my Brick-Hou≈øe, the Foundation of which was laid at my going, which I de≈øign after a good manner, to encourage others, and that from building with Wood; it being the fir≈øt, many take example; and ≈øome that built wooden Hou≈øes, are ≈øorry for it; Brick Building is ≈øaid to be as cheap: Bricks
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:199140:73"/> are exceeding good, and better than when I built, more makers fallen in, and Bricks cheaper; they were before at 16 <hi>s. Engli≈øh, per</hi> Thou≈øand, and now many brave Brick hou≈øes are going up with good Cellars. <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> is building him a brave Brick Hou≈øe near <hi>William Frampton</hi>'s, on the Front; for <hi>William Frampton</hi> hath ≈øince built a good Brick Hou≈øe, by his Brew-hou≈øe and Bake-hou≈øe, and lett the other for an Ordinary. <hi>John Wheeler</hi> from <hi>New-England,</hi> is building a good Brick Hou≈øe by the <hi>Blew Anchor,</hi> and the two Brick-makers a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Brick Hou≈øe and Cellars; be≈øides ≈øeveral other going on. <hi>Samuel Carpenter</hi> has built another Hou≈øe by his. I am building another Brick Hou≈øe by mine, which is three large Stories high, be≈øides a good large Brick Cellar under it of two Bricks and a half thickne≈øs in the Wall, and the next Story half under ground; the Cellar has an arched Door for a Vault to go (under the Street) to the River, and ≈øo to bring in Goods, or deliver out. <hi>Humphrey Murry,</hi> from <hi>New-York,</hi> has built a large Timber-Hou≈øe with Brick Chimneys. <hi>John Test</hi> has almo≈øt fini≈øhed a good Brick Hou≈øe, and a Bake-hou≈øe of Timber; and <hi>N.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199140:73"/> Lots are much de≈øired in the Town; great buying one of anothe. We are now laying the Foundation of a large plain Brick Hou≈øe for a Meeting-Hou≈øe, in the Center (≈øixty foot long, and about forty foot broad) and hope to have it ≈øoon up, there being many hearts and hands at work that will do it: A large Meeting-hou≈øe, fifty foot long, and thirty eight broad al≈øo going on the front of the River, for an Evening-Meeting, the Work going on apace; many Towns-people ≈øetling their Liberty-Lands. I hope the Society will rub off the Reproaches ≈øome have ca≈øt upon them. We now begin to gather in ≈øomething of our many great Debts.</p>
                        <p>I do under≈øtand three Companies for Whale-catching, are de≈øigned to fi≈øh in the Rivers-mouth this Sea≈øon, and find through the great plenty of Fi≈øh, they may begin early. A Fi≈øherman this year found a way to catch <hi>Whitings</hi> in this River; and it is expected, many ≈øorts of Fi≈øh more than has been yet caught, may be taken by the skilful. Fi≈øh are in ≈øuch plenty, that many ≈øorts on Tryal, have been taken with Nets in the Winter-time. The <hi>Swedes</hi> laughing at the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> for going to try, have ≈øince tried them≈øelves. The River is ≈øo big, and full of ≈øeveral ≈øorts of brave Fi≈øh, that its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, except frozen over, we may catch any time in the Winter. It is great pity, but two or three experienced Fi≈øhermen were here to ply this River, to ≈øalt, and ≈øerve, fre≈øh Fi≈øh to the Town. A good way to pickle <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is wanting; ≈øuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance being in the River, even before the Town: many are catcht, boyled, and eaten. La≈øt Winter great plenty of Deer were brought in by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> from the Country.

                  <p n="1">1. It is agreed on all hands, that the poor are the hands and feet of the rich. It is their labour that improves Countries, and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the Publick. Now as there are abundance of the≈øe People in many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> extreamly de≈øirous of going to <hi>America,</hi> ≈øo the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return thereof to the Disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øers, will prove what I ≈øay to be true.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two ≈øorts, ≈øuch as are able to tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them≈øelves and Families, but have nothing to begin with there, and tho≈øe that want ≈øo much as to tran≈øport them≈øelves and Families thither.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fir≈øt of the≈øe may be entertained in this manner. Say I have five thou≈øand Acres, I will ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ten Families upon them in way of Village, and build each an Hou≈øe, an out-Hou≈øe for Cattel, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh every Family with ≈øtock; as four Cows, two Sows, a couple of Mares, and a yoke of Oxen, with a Town-hor≈øe, Bull and Boar. I find them with Tools, and give each their fir≈øt Ground-≈øeed;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199140:75"/> they ≈øhall continue ≈øeven years, or more, at half increa≈øe, being bound to leave the Hou≈øes in repair, and a Garden and Orchard, I paying for the Trees, and at lea≈øt twenty Acres of Land within Fence, and improved to Corn and Gra≈øs. The charge will come to about ≈øixty pounds <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> each Family; at the ≈øeven years end, the improvement will be worth, as things go now, one hundred and twenty pounds, be≈øides the value of the encrea≈øe of the Stock, which may be near as much more, allowing for ca≈øualties, e≈øpecially if the People are hone≈øt and careful, or a man be upon the Spot him≈øelf, or have an Over≈øeer ≈øometimes to in≈øpect them. The charge in the whole is eight hundred thirty and two Pounds. I think I have been mode≈øt in my Computation. The≈øe Farms afterwards are ≈øit for Lea≈øes at full Rent, or how el≈øe the owner ≈øhall plea≈øe to di≈øpo≈øe of them; al≈øo the People will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to ≈øettle them≈øelves with Stock upon their own Land.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The other ≈øort of poor People may be very beneficially tran≈øported upon the≈øe terms. Say I have five thou≈øand Acres, I ≈øhould ≈øettle as before, I will give to each Family one hundred Acres, which in the whole makes one thou≈øand, and to each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily thirty Pounds <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> half in hand and half there, which in the whole comes to three hundred Pounds, after four days are expired, in which time they may be ea≈øie, and in a good condition; they ≈øhall each of them pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> and ≈øo yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm-rent, which in the whole comes to fifty Pounds a year. Thus a Man that buys five thou≈øand Acres may ≈øecure and ≈øettle his four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand by the gift of one, and in a way that hazard and intere≈øt allowed for, amounts to at lea≈øt ten

                     <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon Land ≈øecurity, be≈øides the value it puts upon the re≈øt of the five thou≈øand Acres. I propo≈øe that there be at the lea≈øt two working hands be≈øides the Wife, whether Son or Servant, and that they oblige what they carry; and for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øecurity, bind them≈øelves as Servants for ≈øome time, that they will ≈øettle the ≈øaid Land according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And when they are once ≈øeated their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ≈øecurity enough for the Rent.</p>

There is yet another expedient, and that is, to give ten Families one thou≈øand Acres for ever, at a ≈ømall acknowledgment, and ≈øettle them in way of Village, as afore; by their ≈øeating thus, the Land taken up is ≈øecured from others, becau≈øe the method of the Country is an≈øwered, and the value ≈øuch a ≈øettlement gives to the re≈øt re≈øerved, is not incon≈øiderable, I mean the four thou≈øand Acres, e≈øpecially that which is contiguous, for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when grown up, and Handicrafts, will ≈øoon covet to fix next them, and ≈øuch and ≈øuch after ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements to begin at an improved rent in Fee, or for long Lea≈øes, or ≈ømall acknowledgments, and good improvements mu≈øt advance the whole con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably.

Though Ships go hence all times of the Year,<note place="margin">The ≈øea≈øons of the Ships Pa≈ø≈øage.</note> it mu≈øt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that to go ≈øo as to arrive at Spring or Fall, is be≈øt: For the Summer may be of the hotte≈øt for fre≈øh Comers; and in the Winter the Wind that prevails, is the North-We≈øt, and that blows off the Coa≈øt; ≈øo that ≈øometimes it difficult to enter the Capes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I purpo≈øe therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle of the Months call'd <hi>February</hi> and <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> which (allowing two Months for Pa≈ø≈øage) reaches time enough to plant in the Spring ≈øuch things as are carried hence to plant; and in the Fall, to get a ≈ømall Cottage, and clear ≈øome Land again≈øt the next Spring. I have made a di≈øcovery of about a hundred Miles We≈øt, and find tho≈øe back-Lands richer in Soil, Woods and Fountains, than that by <hi>Delaware,</hi> e≈øpecially upon the <hi>Sa≈øque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanah</hi> River.</p>

                  <p>3. I mu≈øt confe≈øs, I prefer the Fall to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as believing it mo≈øt healthy to be followed with Winter than Summer; though (through the great goodne≈øs and mercy of God) we have had an extraordinary portion of Health for ≈øo new and numerous a Colony, notwith≈øtanding we have not been ≈øo regular in time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Pa≈ø≈øage is not to be ≈øet by any Man, for Ships will be quicker and ≈ølower; ≈øome having been four Months, and ≈øome but one: and as often generally between ≈øix and nine Weeks: One Year, or four and twenty Sail, I think, there was not three above nine, and there was one or two under ≈øix Weeks in Pa≈ø≈øage.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To render it more healthy; it is good to keep as much upon Deck as may be, for the Air helps again≈øt the offen≈øive ≈ømells of a crowd, and a clo≈øe place. Al≈øo to ≈øcrape often the Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry ≈øtore of Rue and Wormwood, and ≈øome Ro≈øemary, or often ≈øprinkle Vinegar about the Cabbin. Pitch burnt is not ami≈øs ≈øometimes, again≈øt faintne≈øs and infectious Scents. I ≈øpeak my experience, for their benefit and direction that may need it.</p>
                  <p>And becau≈øe ≈øome has urged my coming back, as an argument again≈øt the place, and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of its improvement; adding, that I would for that rea≈øon never return: I think fit to ≈øay, That next Summer (God willing) I intend to go back, and carry my Family and the be≈øt part of my per≈øonal E≈øtate with me. And this I do not not only of Duty, but Inclination and Choice. God will ble≈øs and pro≈øper poor <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall conclude with this further notice, That to the end ≈øuch as are willing to embrace any of the foregoing Propo≈øitions, for the improvement

                  <p>Now for you that think of going, thither, I have this to ≈øay, by way of Caution. <q>If an hair of our heads fall not to the ground, without the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, remember your removal is of greater moment.

               <p>The <hi>Caribeans,</hi> who Inhabit divers of tho≈øe I≈ølands, are generally thought to have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven by their Enemies from the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and forced to take ≈øhelter here, having among≈øt them≈øelves various and very different Opinions, Cu≈øtoms and Ceremonies; ≈øuch as live near, and conver≈øe with the Chri≈øtians, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linqui≈øh'd many of their ancient barbarous U≈øages, and have very much civiliz'd their Conver≈øations; which gave occa≈øion to two ancient <hi>Caribeans</hi> to entertain ≈øome of the <hi>European</hi> Chri≈øtians with this or the like Di≈øcour≈øe. <q>Our People are now quite degenerated from what they formerly were, and in a manner become ju≈øt like yours; and ≈øo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are we now grown from what we were before, that we find it a matter of ≈øome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for us to know our≈øelves.

Such Scars and Deformities as they get in the Wars, they glory in, as evident demon≈øtrations of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Their Hair is ≈øtrait and long, the Women attributing the highe≈øt excellency to that which exceeds in blackne≈øs; both Men and Women tye up their Hair behind, which they bind ≈øo hard, that it ≈øtands up upon their Heads like a horn, but hangs loo≈øe upon the top; it falls down again on each ≈øide of their Heads. The Men, ≈øo ≈øoon as their Beards begin to grow, pluck them up by the roots, accounting it a great deformity to the <hi>Europeans</hi> to wear any: both Men and Women go naked, and if any ≈øhould ≈øo much as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to touch their Privy-Parts, all the re≈øt will deride them: and tho≈øe who conver≈øe among≈øt the Chri≈øtians, though they are much civilized, and have for≈øaken many of their odd and barbarous Cu≈øtoms, yet no per≈øwa≈øion can prevail with them to relinqui≈øh this.</p>
               <p>They generally ≈øay, they came naked into the World, and it will be a madne≈øs for them to hide the bodies nature has be≈øtowed upon them; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding which they change the natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their skins, by dying them with a red Compo≈øition, which they make for that purpo≈øe, and wherewith they always anoint them≈øelves after wa≈øhing; and many times, to make them≈øelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more gallant, as they imagine, they draw black Circles about their Eyes with the Juyce of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-Apples;

               <p>There are not many venomous Creatures<note place="margin">Venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> to be found in this I≈øland, nor in any of the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> but yet there are many Snakes and Serpents of many colours and forms, ≈øome whereof are nine or ten foot long, and near as big as a Man's thigh; one whereof being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a whole Hen, feathers and all, were found in her belly, be≈øides a dozen Eggs, upon which the Hen was ≈øitting when the Serpent ≈øeized her, which ≈øhews them to be very large; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding they are not poy≈øonous, but plea≈øure the inhabitants by freeing their Hou≈øes from Rats and other ≈øuch like Vermine, which they kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. There is another ≈øort of Serpent, above an Ell long, and not above an Inch about, which feed upon Frogs and Birds, and are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ≈øo lovely green, that they are very delightful to the eye. But there are two ≈øorts of Snakes that are very hurtful and dangerous; the fir≈øt is gray on the back, and feels ≈øoft like Velvet; the other is either yellow or red, very dreadful to look on, their heads being flat and broad, and their jaws exceeding wide, and armed with eight or ten teeth as ≈øharp as Needles, from whence they produce their poy≈øon, which lies in little pur≈øes near the roots of their teeth; they do not chew their Food, (but ≈øwallow it down whole) for if they ≈øhould, the inhabitants ≈øay, they would poy≈øon them≈øelves: they are ≈øo exceeding veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,

               <p>This Emperour had about thirty Kings under him, his chief Trea≈øure con≈øi≈øting of <hi>Skins, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Pearls, Beads,</hi> and the like, all which were kept in ≈øtore again≈øt his Burial, being re≈øerved on purpo≈øe again≈øt that time; his Hou≈øe being fifty or ≈øixty Yards long, frequented only by Prie≈øts; at the four Corners ≈øtood four Images, as Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, one of a <hi>Bear,</hi> another a <hi>Dragon,</hi> the third a <hi>Leopard,</hi> and the fourth a <hi>Giant:</hi> He hath as many Women as he plea≈øes, whom, after he is grown weary of, he be≈øtows upon his Favorites.

About ten Miles from <hi>James-Town</hi> one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:199140:107"/> of their Kings made a Fea≈øt in the Woods, the people being mo≈øt mon≈øtroully painted, ≈øome like black Devils, with Horns, and their Hair loo≈øe, of variety of colours; they continued two days dancing in a Circle of a quarter of a Mile about, four in a rank, in two companies, exerci≈øing ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Antick Tricks, the King leading the Dance; all in the mid≈øt had black Horns on their Heads, and green Boughs in their Hands; next whom were four or five principal Men, differently paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who with Clubs beat tho≈øe forward that tired in the Dance, which held ≈øo long, that they were ≈øcarce able either to go or ≈øtand; they made a helli≈øh noi≈øe, and throwing away their Boughs, ran clapping their Hands up into a Tree, and tearing down a Branch, fell into their order again.

By Break of Day, before they eat or drink, the Men, Women and Children above ten years old, run into the Water, and there wa≈øh a good ≈øpace, till the Sun ari≈øe; then they offer Sacrifice to it, ≈øtrewing Tobacco on the Land and Water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ≈øame Ceremony at Sun-Set. <hi>George Ca≈ø≈øon</hi> aforementioned, was ≈øacrificed, as they thought, to the Devil, being ≈øtript naked, and bound to two ≈øtakes, with his Back again≈øt a great Fire; after which they ript up his Belly, and burnt his Bowels, drying his Fle≈øh to the Bones, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:199140:108"/> they kept above ground in a Room; many other <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> were cruelly and treacherou≈øly executed by them, though perhaps not ≈øacrificed, and none had e≈øcaped if their Ambu≈øh had ≈øucceeded. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan</hi> invited one Captain <hi>Ratcliff</hi> and thirty others to trade for Corn, and having brought them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Ambu≈øh, murdered them all.</p>

               <p>This was the beginning of <hi>New-England,</hi> when, in the Year 1610. one Mr. <hi>Robin≈øon</hi> a Presbyterian, or rather Independent Preacher, and ≈øeveral other <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> then at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> though they had been courteou≈øly entertained by the <hi>Dutch</hi> as Strangers; yet fore≈øeeing divers inconveniences might follow, and that they could not ≈øo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the good of their Po≈øterity under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Foreign Nation, they re≈øolve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ≈øo much Favour of their Sovereign Prince, King <hi>James,</hi> as to grant them Liberty, under the Protection of his Royal Authority, to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in ≈øome place of <hi>New-England.</hi> Having therefore obtained a Patent or Grant for ≈øome place about <hi>Hud≈øons</hi> River, they ≈øet Sail from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> for the Southern Parts of <hi>New-England;</hi> but as they intended their Cour≈øe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ward, they were through many dangers, at la≈øt, about <hi>November</hi> the eleventh, ca≈øt upon a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom of the South Cape of the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øets</hi> Bay, called Cape <hi>Cod.</hi> When, Winter approached ≈øo fa≈øt, that they had no opportunity to remove, and finding ≈øome encouragement from the hopefulne≈øs of the Soyl, and courte≈øie of the Heathen, they re≈øolved there to make their aboad, laying the Foundation of a new Colony, which from the la≈øt Town they Sailed from in <hi>England,</hi> they called <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> containing no con≈øiderable Tract of Land, ≈øcarce extending one hundred Mile in length through the whole Cape, and not half ≈øo much in breadth, where broade≈øt.</p>

               <p>From this time, to the Year 1636. things were very pro≈øperou≈øly and ≈øucce≈øsfully carried on in <hi>New-England,</hi> which was much increa≈øed in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Inhabitants; at which time, the <hi>Naragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet Indians,</hi> who are the mo≈øt Warlike and Fierce, and much dreaded by all the re≈øt, committed divers outrages upon ≈øeveral of them, and likewi≈øe upon the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as they came occa≈øionally to Trade with them, barbarou≈øly murthering Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Oldham,</hi> with ≈øeveral others: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Inhabitants of all the Colonies unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly falling upon them, in 1637. they were ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, about ≈øeven hundred of them being de≈øtroyed, and the re≈øt cut off by their neighbour <hi>Indians.</hi> Upon which, <hi>Miantonimoh,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Magchins,</hi> expecting to be ≈øole Lord and Ruler over all the <hi>Indians,</hi> committed many In≈øolencies upon ≈øome others, who were in Confederacy with the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> as well as him≈øelf; and he being ≈øent for to the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øacu≈øets</hi> Court, at <hi>Bo≈øton,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clear him≈øelf, but was clearly convicted by one of his fellows, named <hi>

               <p>Upon a due inquiry therefore of all the Tran≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> from their fir≈øt ≈øetling on the≈øe Coa≈øts, there will appear no ground of quarrel or provocation given by the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> For when <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony was fir≈øt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in 1620. within three months after, <hi>Ma≈ø≈øa≈øoit,</hi> the chief <hi>Sachem</hi> or Commander of all that ≈øide of the Country, repairs thither to the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and entred ≈øolemnly into a League upon the following Articles. 1. <hi>That neither he nor any of his ≈øhould injure or do any hurt to any of their People.</hi> 2. <hi>If any of his hurt the</hi> Engli≈øh, <hi>he ≈øhould ≈øend them the offender to puni≈øh.</hi> 3. <hi>If any thing ≈øhould be taken away by his, he ≈øhould ≈øee it re≈øtored, and the</hi> Engli≈øh <hi>to do the like to them.</hi> 4. <hi>If any made War unju≈øtly again≈øt him, they were to aid him, and he likewi≈øe them.</hi> 5. <hi>That he ≈øhould certifie his neighbour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates hereof, that they might be likewi≈øe compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in the Peace.</hi> 6. <hi>That when his men ≈øhould come to the</hi> Engli≈øh <hi>they ≈øhould leave their Arms behind;</hi> which were then Bows and Arrows, and were then their only Weapons, though now they have learn- the u≈øe of Guns and Swords as well as the Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

Which being di≈øcovered by <hi>John Sau≈øaman, Philip</hi> thereupon cau≈øed him to be murthered; the Murtherers being apprehended, were Executed, and <hi>Philip</hi> fearing his own Head, got openly into Arms, killing, burning and de≈øtroying the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and their Habitations, with all manner of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Cruelty.

               <p>For ≈øuch was his hatred again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> that he could not hear any thing ≈øhould be ≈øugge≈øted to him about Peace, in≈øomuch that he cau≈øed one of his Confederates to be kill'd for propounding it; which ≈øo provoked ≈øome of his Company, not altogether ≈øo de≈øperate as him≈øelf, that one of them (that was near Kin to him that was killed) fled to <hi>Road-I≈øland,</hi> and informed Captain <hi>Church</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> was, offering to lead him thither: Upon this welcome news, a ≈ømall Party of <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> came very early in the Morning and ≈øurrounded his Swamp, from whence (as he was endeavouring to make his e≈øcape) he was ≈øhot through the Heart by an <hi>Indian</hi> of his own Nation; for Capt. <hi>Church</hi> having appointed an <hi>Engli≈øhman</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> to ≈øtand at ≈øuch a place of the Swamp, where it happen'd that <hi>Philip</hi> was breaking through; the Morning being very wet and rainy, the <hi>Engli≈øhman</hi>'s Gun would not fire; the <hi>Indian</hi> having an old Musket, with a large Touch-hole, it took fire the more readily; which when <hi>Philip</hi> was di≈øpatch'd, the Bullet pa≈ø≈øing directly through his heart, ≈øoon after ≈øeveral of his Confederates and Coun≈øellors were taken, and ≈øuffered de≈øerved

               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> 19. 1677. About Sun-≈øet, I and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man being together, the <hi>Indians</hi> with great ≈øhouting and ≈øhooting came upon us, and ≈øome other of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> hard by, at which we ran to a Swamp for refuge; which they perceiving, made after us, and ≈øhot at us, three Guns being di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon me; the Swamp being mine, I ≈ølipt in, and fell down; whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> ≈øtept to me, with his Hatchet lifted up to knock me on the head, ≈øuppo≈øing I was wounded, and unfit for Travel: It happened I had a Pi≈øtol in my Pocket, which (though uncharged) I pre≈øented to him, who pre≈øently ≈øtept back, and told me, if I would yield I ≈øhould have no hurt, boa≈øting fal≈øely, that they had de≈øtroyed all <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and that the Woods were full of <hi>Indians;</hi> whereupon I yielded my≈øelf, and fell into the Enemies Hands, and by three of them was led away to the place whence I fir≈øt fled; where two other <hi>Indians</hi> came running to us, and one lifting up the But-end of his Gun to knock me on the head, the other with his hand put by the blow, and ≈øaid I was his Friend. I was now near my own Hou≈øe, which the <hi>Indians</hi> burnt la≈øt year, and I was about to build up again, and there I had ≈øome hopes to e≈øcape from them; there was a Hor≈øe ju≈øt by, which they bid me take, I did ≈øo, but attempted no e≈øcape, becau≈øe the Bea≈øt was
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:199140:126"/> dull and ≈ølow, and I thought they would ≈øend me to take my own Hor≈øes; which they did, but they were ≈øo frighted, that I could not come near them, and ≈øo fell again into the Enemies Hands, who now took me, bound me, and led me away. Soon after, I was brought to other Captives, who were that day taken at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> which moved two contrary Pa≈ø≈øions, Joy, to have Company; and Sorrow, that we were in that mi≈øerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: We were all pinion'd and led away in the Night over the Mountains, in dark and hideous ways, about four Miles further, before we took up our place of re≈øt, which was a di≈ømal place of a Wood on the Ea≈øt-≈øide of that Mountain; we were kept bound all that night, the <hi>Indians</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, who, as they Travell'd, made ≈øtrange noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, as of Wolves, Owls, and other Birds and Bea≈øts, that they might not lo≈øe one another; and if followed, might not be di≈øcover'd by the <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About break of day we marched again, and got over the great River <hi>Pecompt uck;</hi> there the <hi>Indians</hi> marched out upon Trays, the number of their Captives and Slain, as there manner is: Here I was again in great dange0r, a quarrel ari≈øing who≈øe Captive I was, and I was afraid I mu≈øt be killed to end the controver≈øie; they then asked me who≈øe I was, I ≈øaid three <hi>Indians</hi> took me; ≈øo they agreed to have all a ≈øhare in me: I had now three Ma≈øters, but the Chief was he that fir≈øt laid hands on me, which happened to be the wor≈øt of the company, as <hi>A≈øhpelon</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Captain told me, who was always very kind to me, and a great comfort to the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> In this place they gave us Victuals which they had brought away from the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and ten Men were again ≈øent out for more
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:199140:126"/> Plunder, ≈øome of whom brought Provi≈øion, others Corn out of the Meadows, upon Hor≈øes; from hence we went up above the Falls, where we cro≈øt that River again, when I fell down-right Lame of my old Wounds received in the War; but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øion of being killed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and what cruel death they would put me to, ≈øoon frighted away my pain, and I was very brisk again. We had eleven Hor≈øes in that company? which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Burthens and the Women; we travell'd up the River till night, and then took up our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a di≈ømal place, being laid on our Backs and ≈øtaked down, in which po≈øture we lay many nights together; the manner was, our arms and legs being ≈øtretched out, were ≈øtaked fa≈øt down, and a Cord put about our necks, ≈øo that we could not po≈ø≈øibly ≈øtir; the fir≈øt night (being much tired) I ≈ølept as comfortably as ever; the next we lay in the <hi>Saquahog</hi>-Meadows; our Provi≈øion was ≈øoon ≈øpent, and whil≈øt we were there, the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting, and the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army came out after us. Then the <hi>Indians</hi> moved again, dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves and the Captives into many companies, that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> might not follow their Track; at night, having cro≈ø≈øed the River, we met again at the place appointed; the next day were pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed it, where we continued a long time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about thirty Miles above <hi>Squag,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> were quite out of fear of the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> but much afraid of the <hi>Mo-hawks,</hi> another ≈øort of <hi>Indians,</hi> Enemies to them.</p>
               <p>In this place they built a ≈øtrong <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and had a great Daunce, as they call'd it, where it was concluded to burn three of us; having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Bark for that purpo≈øe, of whom (as I heard afterwards) I was to be one, Serjeant <hi>Plumpton</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:199140:127"/> another, and the Wife of <hi>Benjamin Wait</hi> the third; I knew not then who they were, yet I under≈øtood ≈øo much of their Language, that I perceived ≈øome were de≈øigned thereto; that night I could not ≈øleep for fear of the next day's work, the <hi>Indians</hi> (weary with dancing) lay down and ≈øtept ≈øoundly. The <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were all loo≈øe, whereupon I went out for Wood, and mended the fire, making a noi≈øe on purpo≈øe, but none awaked; I thought if any of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> ≈øhould wake, we might kill them all ≈øleeping; to which end I removed out of the way all the Guns and Hatchets, but my heart failing, I put all things where they were again. The next day (when they intended to burn us) our Ma≈øter and ≈øome others ≈øpoke for us, and the evil was prevented at this time: We lay here about three Weeks, where I had a Shirt brought me to make; one <hi>Indian</hi> ≈øaid it ≈øhould be made this way, another a different way, and a third this way, whereupon I told them I would make it according to my chief Ma≈øter's order; upon this an <hi>Indian</hi> ≈øtruck me on the face with his fi≈øt, I ≈øuddenly ro≈øe in anger to return it again, which rai≈øed a great Hubbub; the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> coming about me, I was fain to humble my ≈øelf to my Ma≈øter, which ended the matter. Before I came to this place, my three Ma≈øters were gone a Hunting, and I was left with only one <hi>Indian</hi> (all the company being upon a march) who fell ≈øick, ≈øo that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hatchet, whereby I had opportunity to have di≈øpatched him, but did not, becau≈øe the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Captives had engag'd the contrary to each other, ≈øince if one ≈øhould run away, it would much endanger the remainder: Whil≈øt we were here, <hi>Benjamin Stebbins,</hi> going with ≈øome <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Wachu≈øet</hi> Hills, made his e≈øcape, the tydings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:199140:127"/> cau≈øed us all to be called in and bound. One of the <hi>Indians</hi> Captains, and always our great Friend, met me coming in, and told me <hi>Stebbins</hi> was run away, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ≈øpoke of burning us; ≈øome were only for burning our fingers, and then biting them off; he ≈øaid there would be a Court, and all would ≈øpeak their minds, but he would ≈øpeak la≈øt, and declare, That the <hi>Indian,</hi> who ≈øuffered <hi>Stebbins</hi> to make his e≈øcape, was only in fault; and bid us not fear any hurt ≈øhould happen to us, and ≈øo it prov'd accordingly.</p>
               <p>Whil≈øt we lingered here-about, Provi≈øion grew ≈øcarce, one Bear's Foot mu≈øt ≈øerve five of us a whole day; we began to eat Hor≈øe-fle≈øh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ≈øeveral Hor≈øes, three only being left alive. At this time the <hi>Indians</hi> had fallen upon <hi>Hadley,</hi> where ≈øome of them being taken, were relea≈øed, upon promi≈øe of meeting the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> on ≈øuch a Plain, to make further Terms: Captain <hi>A≈øhpalon</hi> was much for it, but the <hi>Sachins</hi> of <hi>Wachu≈øet,</hi> when they came, were again≈øt it; yet were willing to meet the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> only to fall upon and de≈øtroy them. <hi>A≈øhpalon</hi> charged us <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> not to ≈øpeak a word of this, ≈øince mi≈øchief would come of it.

               <p>One <hi>Samuel Chaplain,</hi> in 1603. gives an acconnt of a Fea≈øt made by one of their Great Lords in his Cabbin; eight or ten Kettles of Meat were ≈øet on ≈øeveral Fires, ≈øome yards a≈øunder: The men ≈øate on both ≈øides the Room, each of them having a Di≈øh of the Bark of a Tree, one of which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to give every man his Portion.

                  <p>SUppo≈øe a man that has an Hundred Pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> is minded to tran≈øport him≈øelf and Family, con≈øi≈øting of Eleven in number, to this I≈øland of <hi>Tobago</hi> and ≈øuppo≈øe their Pa≈ø≈øage co≈øt him fifty pound, and Manuals, with other things requi≈øite and nece≈ø≈øary for Planting, as al≈øo Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion for the fir≈øt Twelve Months, together with the Charge of Hou≈øhold-≈øtuffs, and all other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øaries, may ≈øtand him in forty ≈øeven pound ten ≈øhillings more; ≈øuppo≈øe al≈øo this man takes a Lea≈øe of fifty Acres of Land for a Thou≈øand Years at the rate of Twelve pence an Acre annually, it amounts but to Two pound Ten ≈øhillings a Year (except otherwi≈øe he purcha≈øe the Fee ≈øimple of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors) which compleats the Hundred pound. This is the fir≈øt Money laid out, nor need he be at any more Charge for in twelve Months time, he will have Ground-provi≈øion enough, and in all probability two Crops of <hi>Tobacco.</hi>

                  <p>The next thing to con≈øider of, is the Improvement<note place="margin">Its Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of the ≈øaid Land, which is as followeth: After your arrival in the I≈øland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> the fir≈øt ≈øix Months may be ≈øpent to clear fifteen Acres of Land, and to put Provi≈øns into the Ground; to build Conveniencies to accommodate your ≈øelf and Family; to adapt and fit Ground for planting a Nur≈øery of <hi>Cacao-Nuts;</hi> as al≈øo a Bed ≈øowed with <hi>Tobacco-≈øeeds,</hi> and be ≈øure to keep your Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øery clear from Weeds: then, about a Months time after, you have ≈øown your <hi>Tobacco-≈øeed,</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Sea≈øon be good) you may then draw your <hi>Tobacco-Plants,</hi> and plant them about ≈øome four foot di≈øtance one from another, regularly and in rows, which ≈øaid <hi>Tobacco, Tobago</hi> produces, is nothing inferiour to <hi>Spani≈øh Trinidado,</hi> that lies about ≈øeven Leagues di≈øtance from the ≈øaid I≈øland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> who ≈øell their <hi>Trinidado-Tobacco</hi> at the rate of Two Shillings a Pound, which ≈øaid <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tran≈øport from thence to <hi>Old Spain,</hi> and ≈øell it there for con≈øiderable advantage. Now among your <hi>Tobacco-Plants,</hi> you may plant your <hi>Cacao,</hi> and tran≈øplant them, when about ≈øix Months old, into new Ground, at ten or twelve foot di≈øtance, and be ≈øure to keep them clear from Weeds, in which latter ≈øix Months time, you may have on your cleared Ground two Crops of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</hi> Now admitting you make but Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Weight of <hi>Neat Tobacco</hi> on the ≈øaid Ground, yet in all probability (provided your People be healthy) it may double the number to Sixteen thou≈øand. But if it do not, and put the ca≈øe your <hi>Tobacco</hi> ≈øell but for an eighth part of what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ≈øell for in <hi>Trinidado,</hi> (which is but three Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound, ≈øold here in our I≈øland) yet will
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:199140:142"/> this Crop yield you One hundred Pound <hi>≈øterling,</hi> which is your Money gained the very fir≈øt Year, and in ≈øix Months time all Charges being born.</p>
                  <p>Now ≈øuppo≈øe at the beginning of the ≈øecond Year, the ≈øaid ≈øixteen Acres be all cleared, and Provi≈øion enough put into the Ground, ≈øufficient for double your number of hands, you may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally then expect four Crops in twelve Months time, when as formerly you made two Crops in the la≈øt ≈øix Months; ≈øo that with the Hundred Pounds you gained la≈øt Year, you may now purcha≈øe ≈øeven or eight Slaves, or Servants, which may in all probability treble the fir≈øt Year. But put the ca≈øe, it but only double, yet at the wor≈øt, it may yield you (and all Charges born) Two hundred Pounds <hi>≈øterling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we cannot otherwi≈øe conclude, (if things ≈øucceed well) but the third Year will double the ≈øecond by improvement, as is above expre≈ø≈øed; and if ≈øo, your Crop will amount to Four hundred Pounds <hi>≈øterling,</hi> and the fourth Year double the third, by rea≈øon of the <hi>Cacao</hi> that was planted the fir≈øt Year on the fifteen Acres of Land, may produce to the value of Thirty Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> an Acre, be≈øides the encrea≈øe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and clearing of more ground, together with your encrea≈øe of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ana Slaves, and planting of more <hi>Cacao-Trees,</hi> which at lea≈øt will ari≈øe to Eight hundred Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> the fourth Year; the fifth Year, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, doubles the fourth Year; the ≈øixth Year you may very well clear Six thou≈øand Pounds <hi>≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and all Charges born, by rea≈øon the <hi>Cacao,</hi> planted the fir≈øt Year, is now come to perfection, and at its full height of bearing; which in this Latitude may yield One hundred Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> an Acre, <hi>viz.</hi> the fir≈øt fifteen Acres which were planted
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:199140:143"/> the fir≈øt Year; and the ≈øecond years Plants, planted the ≈øecond Year, will yield you Sixty Pounds <hi>≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> and the third years Plants, as by the ≈øame Calculation, may yield you Thirty Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> an Acre: So that by purcha≈øing the more Servants and Slaves, you may, if you plea≈øe, decline ≈øo much planting of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as formerly you did.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øeventh Year you will have all your Land planted with <hi>Cacao,</hi> and that increa≈øing, you need not plant above ten or fiften Acres of <hi>Tobacco</hi> this Year among≈øt your <hi>Cacao;</hi> but you may plant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions among≈øt them, for ≈øupport and maintenance of your ≈øelf and Family.

                  <p>Now pray con≈øider, that we can have <hi>Negro</hi>-≈ølaves brought and delivered to us at Fifteen Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> a head, by rea≈øon we have an open Trade, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> allows not of a free Trade. Where note, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pays Six-pence or more for every thing he wants, when we have the ≈øame for a ≈øingle Penny. That's one Rea≈øon.</p>

                  <p>The ≈øecond Rea≈øon is, The <hi>Spaniard</hi> cannot have any Tunnage for Goods from <hi>Old Spain</hi> to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and home again, for le≈øs than Forty or Fifty Pounds <hi>≈øterling per</hi> Tun; be≈øides, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties run very high: And we can have, Freight for Five or Six Pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, and no Duties from us to a tree Port. When therefore, to con≈øider and compute the Charge on either ≈øide, we profit by what we tran≈øport ≈øix to one; which makes the <hi>Spaniard</hi> generally ≈øo poor in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and we generally to flouri≈øh ≈øo much the more.</p>
                  <p>The third Rea≈øon is, That in a Ship of Three hundred Tun, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ≈øeldom le≈øs than two hundred Men belonging to her, and the Wages each Man comes to at lea≈øt Fifty Shilling <hi>≈øterling per</hi> Month, which, in the whole, amounts to Five hundred Pounds a Month, barely for Wages; then you are to con≈øider the Monthly Provi≈øions, to accommodate the≈øe Men, cannot come to le≈øs than One hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>≈øterling;</hi> and Ten Months, at Six hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month, amounts to Six thou≈øand and five hundred Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> for Ten Months. Moreover, this Ship of Three hundred Tun, ≈øeldom carries le≈øs than Forty Pieces of Ordnance, which with their Provi≈øions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by mode≈øt computation, takes up no le≈øs room than One hundred and fifty Tun; ≈øo that the Ship, in all probability, cannot bring home more than One hundred and fifty Tun of Merchants Goods, and the Freight of the≈øe Goods comes to Forty Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> a Tun, to pay Ware and Tare of the Ship and Mens Wages; ≈øo that for the Ship's Ware and Tare, it comes barely but to One hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>≈øterling</hi> clear.</p>
