            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE enſuing Diſcourſe contains an Account of the Preſent State of His Majeſties Dominions, on the Coaſt of <hi>America;</hi> wherein thou wilt find a conſiderable Diſcovery of the growing Greatneſs of thoſe diſtant Colonies, which, by the moſt clement and wiſe Adminiſtration of the Monarchs of <hi>Great Britan,</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready arrived to a Figure ſo Conſiderable, as may attract the Emulation of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Potentates; the Golden <hi>Peru</hi> hardly affording ſo great a Treaſure to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Crown, as theſe moſt Flouriſhing Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons produce to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> The vaſt Returns which the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and other Parts of His Majeſties Dominions, make from thoſe Parts, are a ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for any one that would ſtudy the Improvement of his Fortunes, to look into the advantages of that Extenſive Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb facs="tcp:199140:4"/> which thoſe Regions produce. And ſince our Neighbours have not been wanting (in the moſt Remote Courts) to repreſent their Foreign Plantations as vaſt and mighty Acceſſions to their Government, and to make their State look the more Conſiderable in the Eyes of diſtant Monarchs: Why may not an Eſſay towards the Delineation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territories in Foreign Parts (at leaſt in ſome meaſure) contribute to raiſe in them an Eſteem and Dread of the Mighty Power of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown. Little more need be ſaid to recommend the uſefulneſs of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe, but that the natural reſult of Diſcoveries, is the Promotion of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Conſiderate know how to make their Advantages thereof.</p>
            <p>There was intended to be added to this Volume, a Summary of the ſeveral Laws in Force in each Plantation, but that being a work which will ſwell to a larger Bulk than this, is reſerved for a particular Treatiſe by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have one thing more to advertiſe thee, That the Printer hath neglected to fix the Running-Title on the top of every Page; therefore thou may'ſt find that part of the Diſcourſe which relates to them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Table.</p>

However no part of this <hi>Iſland</hi> is in the leaſt ſubject to thoſe violent and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Storms called <hi>Hurricans,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbies</hi> and ſome other places in thoſe parts are ſometimes peſtered; which with a ſudden fury
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199140:12"/> drive their Ships from Harbour, caſt them on ſhore, blow down their Houſes, tear up their Canes, and hurry all into confuſion. And had not this <hi>Iſland</hi> afforded Relief to many of the wracked Inhabitants when they had been thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, they muſt in all probability have periſhed. Nor doth any part of this Iſland unavoidably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate any of its new Inhabitants to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſtemper, as <hi>Virginia</hi> and other places do; but if thoſe who go thither, will upon their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, but forbear exceſs of eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, uſe moderate exerciſe, and make choice of ſuch places for their ſettlement, as lie not too low in Vallies, where there comes but little Air; or too near Rivers, where they may peradventure be incommoded with too much moiſture, or at the Foot of <hi>Mountains</hi> or <hi>Moraſſes,</hi> where probably you may have more Rain than you'l deſire; nor by the Sea ſide, or upon Bays, where beſides the inconvenience of its Sandineſs, it will occaſion your want of good Water, you will be mightily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the violent Reflections of the Sun's Beams, which are much fiercer here than in other parts of the Iſle.</p>
               <p>It hath been obſerved by ſome who have lived in the Iſland, that the Mountains which run along through the midſt of the Iſle from one extream point to the other, are much cooler than the other parts; inſomuch that ſometimes in the Morning early there are ſmall white Froſts.</p>
               <p>As for the Weather, it is leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Jamaica</hi> than in the reſt of the <hi>Caribby Iſlands;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Air.</note> but wet Seaſons are moſt expected in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>November.</hi> The Winds blow conſtantly from the <hi>East</hi> without the leaſt variation, which they call <hi>Briezes:</hi> They uſually
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199140:12"/> riſe about Nine in the Morning, and blow freſher as the Sun mounts higher; ſo that Travel and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour are tolerable at Mid-day. Theſe Eaſterly Winds commonly blow till about ſix or ſeven in the Afternoon, and then they change to the Weſt; which the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> call <hi>Land-Briezes,</hi> becauſe they blow off the Shoar, and carry their Ships and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels out of their Harbors.</p>
               <p>There is no apparent Winter, only they have ſomewhat more Rain and Thunder in the Winter-Months than at other times; nor doth the length of the Days and Nights vary much, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue almoſt all the year round of an equal length, <hi>(viz.)</hi> about fifteen hours day: And that which ſeems much ſtranger, is, the Seas having ſeldom been obſerved to ebb or flow above a foot or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; nor hath any Pilot ever yet been able to give a certain account of the Currents of thoſe Seas, in regard they are ſo various and uncertain; nor could any ever give a reaſon why the Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Earthquakes ſhould never reach <hi>Jamaica,</hi> although they have ſo grievouſly afflicted the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Iſlands.</p>
               <p>The Rivers of this Iſland are none of them fair or navigable up into the Country,<note place="margin">Its Road and Harbors.</note> in regard the Iſland is very mountainous, and their original is for the moſt part in thoſe Hills that run through its Center; which running Eaſt and Weſt, the Rivers that riſe in them diſembogue themſelves North and South, and falling out of thoſe high Mountains, are very fierce and rapid in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; being likewiſe in regard of the great Rains, ſubject to great and ſudden Inundations; at which times they fall with ſuch fury, that great Stone-Rocks and large pieces of Timber are born down,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199140:13"/> and carried along by the violence of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which makes their uſual paſſage ſo foul and troubleſom, that they are thereby rendred alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unpaſſable by Boats and other ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Beſides which, there are divers of them which at ſome times have not one drop of Water in them, but are wholly dried up, which renders them likewiſe uſeleſs for Navigation; as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of <hi>Minoa,</hi> that runs through <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which ſometimes hath not a drop of Water, and yet at other Seaſons hath as much as the River of <hi>Thames</hi> at high-water: But although the Rivers are thus uſeleſs, yet towards the Sea the Iſland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with great plenty of very good Bays, Roads and Harbours; the principal whereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Port-Royal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Port-Royal.</note> which at it firſt ſetling by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſoon after they took the Iſland from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> received the Name of <hi>Cagway,</hi> but when the Town began to encreaſe, and draw towards its perfection, it obtained in Sir <hi>Charles Littleton</hi>'s time the Name of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of its Harbour. It is ſituated on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream end of that long point of Land that makes the Harbour, running about twelve Miles from the Main Weſterly, having the Sea on its South, and the Harbour on the North; which Harbour is ſo exceeding ſafe and commodious for Shipping, that they are ſecure in all Weathers, and can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade themſelves afloat at the Merchants-Key; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe during their Riding there, ſecured from any Attempts that might be made on them by an Enemy, by one of the ſtrongeſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Caſtles that His Majeſty hath in all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> which is well garriſonn'd with Souldiers, and hath above ſixty Pieces of Cannon mounted in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199140:13"/> it. Beſides which, it is Land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs Twelve Miles <hi>South-East</hi> from the Main of the Iſland, and hath the great River which runs by <hi>Los-Angelos</hi> and St. <hi>Jago</hi> (where Ships that trade to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> commonly water, and provide themſelves with what Wood they want for their Voyage back) falling into it. The Harbour is about three Leagues broad in moſt places, and is ſo deep, that a Ship of a Thouſand Tun may lay her ſides to the Shoar of the Point, and load and unload at pleaſure; nor doth there want good Anchorage in any part of it. This Harbour being ſo exceeding ſafe and commodious, is the reaſon why it is frequented both by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships and Men of War more than any other Port in that Iſland.</p>
               <p>The Point of Land whereon the Town is built, is exceeding narrow, and nothing but a looſe Sand, ſo that it affords neither <hi>Graſs, Stone, freſh Water, Trees,</hi> nor any thing elſe which could encourage the building a Town upon it, beſides the goodneſs of the Harbour. It was at firſt began by building a few Ware-houſes, but is now grown exceeding large and populous; for it contains above fifteen hundred Houſes, and extends itſelf about twelve or thirteen Miles in length, being inhabited by Merchants, Store-houſe-keepers, Handicraftſmen, Vintners, Victuallers, and the like: And being ſo very populous, and ſo much frequented by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as well as the Planters in the Negotiation of their Affairs, it being, as it were, the Scale of Trade in that Iſland, the Houſes are as dear rented as in well Traded Streets in <hi>London,</hi> and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are dearer than in any other place in that Iſland.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:199140:14"/>
               <p>In the time of the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there was a ſtately Church built, partly by <hi>Liberal Subſcriptions</hi> of divers well diſpoſed <hi>Gentlemen</hi> inhabiting the Iſle, and partly by an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsment laid upon the Inhabitants of the Port. There is likewiſe a Houſe belonging to the King, though it is not very ſpacious. This Town of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> lieth about twelve Miles from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Town of this Iſland, called St. <hi>Jago de la Vega,</hi> or the <hi>Spaniſh Town.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Old Harbour.</note> about ſeven miles Weſtward from St. <hi>Jago,</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally accounted next to <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> the beſt Harbour on the South-ſide; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, it is not ſo much frequented as it was when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enjoy'd the Iſle; ſo that there are not above thirty Houſes there, which are chiefly for the Uſes of thoſe Veſſels and Mariners that come thither, and for Store-houſes for Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Goods.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199140:16"/> at <hi>Barbados,</hi> and other of our <hi>American</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to come and inhabit here; ſo that in a little time it will, in all probability, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few years become the richeſt, and the moſt populous, and potent Plantation in all the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe Inhabitants of the fourteen Precincts, there are reckoned to belong to <hi>Jamaica</hi> four thouſand Privateers, Sloop and Boat-men, that ply up and down about the Iſle, who are all ſtout, reſolute, fighting Men; which they have ſufficiently demonſtrated in their late Exploits, and deſperate Attempts upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Panama,</hi> and other Parts in the South-Seas.</p>
               <p>This Iſle abounds with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Commodities; as,<note place="margin">Its Product.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GARS,</hi> which are ſo good, that they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell thoſe that are made in <hi>Barbados</hi> five ſhillings <hi>per Cent.</hi> There are near an hundred of theſe Sugar-Works, which produced every year above two hundred thouſand weight of Sugar: Theſe Sugar-Works are likewiſe continually increaſing every year, and new are always going up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CACAO,</hi> whereof we make <hi>Chocolate,</hi> is, by reaſon of the natural aptneſs of the Ground to produce and bear it, the moſt beneficial and ſtaple Commodity of the Iſland; there being near an hundred <hi>Cacao-Walks,</hi> beſides abundance of young ones newly planted and growing up, and others that are ſtill planting; ſo that it will in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt noted place for that Commodity in the World; which will redound to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Planters, in regard it is ſo much uſed by us and other neighbouring Nations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who uſe ſuch vaſt quantities of it, they alone are enough to take off all that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199140:17"/> the Iſland produces; ſo that there is no fear that it will ever prove a Drug, and lie upon their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>INDICO,</hi> which the Iſle produces in great abundance, and very good, there being already above eighty <hi>Indico-Works,</hi> which produce above ſixty thouſand weight of <hi>Indico per annum;</hi> which <hi>Works</hi> do likewiſe very much increaſe every year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>COTTON</hi> is another of their Products, which is very fine, and is therefore preferred by all that deal in that Commodity, before that which grows in any of the <hi>Caribby Iſlands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TOBACCO,</hi> which is here indifferent good, being accounted much better than that which grows at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> but other Commodities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more beneficial to the Iſlanders, there is not much of it planted, only what ſerves for their own ſpending.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TORTOISE-SHELLS,</hi> which are in ſo much eſteem with us in <hi>England</hi> for ſeveral cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Works, and therefore find as ready a vent as any Commodity whatſoever that is brought us from beyond the Seas. There are abundance of them taken on this Coaſt, there being a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in the taking them, beſides the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing of the Shells, for their Fleſh are excellent Meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HIDES,</hi> great quantities, whereof have been yearly made there, and are found to be very large and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WOODS</hi> for the uſe of <hi>Dyers,</hi> whereof there are great variety, as <hi>Fuſtick, Red-Wood,</hi> &amp;c. Here is likewiſe <hi>Cedar, Mathogency, Braſilletto, Lignum Vitae, Ebony, Granadilla,</hi> and divers other excellent ſweet ſmelling and curious Woods, fit for the choiceſt Works, whoſe Names are yet unknown,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199140:17"/> and ſo indeed are their excellencies; however, great quantities of 'em are continually exported thence, and great profit made of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SALT</hi> is another of the Products of this Iſland, which might be made here in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, there being already three very large <hi>Salt-Ponds,</hi> containing near Four thouſand Acres of ground, and there was made, in one Year, about Ten thouſand Buſhels; and the manager of it, Captain <hi>John Noye,</hi> affirmed, That he could as well have made ſo many Tun, if they had had vent for it. But, at preſent, they make little more than what is ſpent in the Iſland. Nor is it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of other Salts, there having been good quantities of <hi>Nitre</hi> found in divers places in the Iſle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GINGER,</hi> grows better there, than it doth in many other of the <hi>Caribby Iſlands,</hi> which hath occaſioned the planting great quantities of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>COD-PEPPER</hi> likewiſe, which is a Spice very much uſed in all the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> grows in great plenty there; and ſo doth</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PIEMENTO,</hi> or a certain Spice which is better known by name of <hi>Jamaica-Pepper,</hi> very aromatical, and of a curious flavor, having the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act taſte both of Cinamon and Cloves, with a complicated mixtute of divers other ſweet and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spices. This Spice the Iſland doth naturally produce; for it grows wild upon the mountainous parts of it; ſome whereof are plantable, and others ſo ſtony, that are unplantable; but both are generally covered with excellent Timber and great abundancy of Fruit and Spice-trees. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when they enjoyed the place, ſet a high value upon this Spice, and exported it as a very choice Commodity, as indeed it is; and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:199140:18"/> finding ſo good a vent for it, intend to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them therein, and begin now to bring it into their Plantations, which will in time turn them to great account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GS,</hi> which this Iſland produces in great abundance, as, <hi>Guiacum, China-roots, Sarſaparilla, Caſſia-Fiſtula, Tamerinds, Vinello's</hi> and <hi>Achiots</hi> or <hi>Anetto,</hi> which is like to prove a good Commodity. There are alſo divers ſorts of</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MS</hi> and <hi>Roots</hi> wherewith experienced Planters cure divers Wounds, Ulcers and other Maladies; as, <hi>Aloes, Benjamin,</hi> and the like: And by the report of an intelligent <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who made it his buſineſs to enquire and ſearch after ſuch things, there is likewiſe <hi>Cyperas, Contrayerva, Adjunctum nigrum, Cucumis agreſtis, Sumach, Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Miſleto,</hi> with many other <hi>Drugs, Balſams</hi> and <hi>Gums,</hi> whoſe Names and Virtues are not known or remembred. However the Planters begin every year to be better and better acquainted with their Nature and Uſe, and endeavour to encreaſe them, in order to their ſupplying <hi>England</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>COCHANEIL</hi> is likewiſe produced by a Plant that grows in this Iſle; but the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being as yet not very well skill'd in husbanding of it, and the Eaſt-winds, and many other things being enemies to its growth, its product is not very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and the like Commodities are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this Iſland, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have already, and will in a little time improve to that degree, that it will quickly become the beſt and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Plantation that they ever were or are like to be Maſters of; eſpecially if they ſhould find out the <hi>Copper Mines,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay to be in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:199140:18"/> this Iſland, with ſome whereof they affirm the <hi>Bells</hi> that hung in the great Church at St. <hi>Jago</hi> to be caſt. And the <hi>Silver Mines,</hi> which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be here as well as in <hi>Cuba</hi> and the Main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> affirm they found one behind the Mountains, on the Weſt of <hi>Cag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I paſs from this Diſcourſe, of the Product of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> I ſhall give you an account of the manner of managing a <hi>Cacao Walk,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it is the Chief Commodity of the Iſland, with a particular calculation of the change in Planting, and the profits that ariſe from it, as it was lately eſtimated by a very judicious and underſtanding perſon, and one who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven great incouragement to divers of the <hi>Planters</hi> there.</p>
               <p>When a perſon, who intends to ſettle at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> arrives,<note place="margin">Of a Cocao Walk.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath taken a view of the Country, his firſt work muſt be to take up Six hundred Acres of Land, which muſt be choſen in a good place, that ſo the Land may be proper to produce the Nut; which Grant, for the Patent and Surveying, will coſt Ten Pounds. Having taken up his Land, he muſt provide himſelf of three <hi>Negro</hi> Men, and as many Women; which, at Twenty Pounds <hi>per</hi> head, will come to an Hundred and twenty Pounds; with four White Servants, which, with their Paſſage and Diet for a Year, will coſt him about Eighty Pounds; with Twenty Axes, and the like number of Bills and Hoes, which will coſt him about Five Pounds; and with an Overſeer, to look after his Servants and keep them to their work, whoſe Wages and Diet, at Forty Shillings a Month, will coſt him Twenty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:199140:19"/> four Pounds: All which, with Eighteen Pounds, which the Proviſions for his Six <hi>Negro</hi> Servants, will, at Four Pence <hi>per</hi> day, each of them coſt him for the firſt ſix Months, till his own Plantation is capable of maintaining them, is Two hundred fifty ſeven Pounds, Five Shillings.</p>
               <p>When this is done, his next buſineſs is to ſet his Servants to work, whoſe firſt imployment muſt be to cut down the Wood, and clear a convenient place, whereon to build fitting Houſes for their Lodging; which, if they begin with <hi>March,</hi> they will have effected by the middle of that Month: After which, he muſt ſet them to felling the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, grubbing up the Roots, and clearing a piece of Ground, of four Acres, whereon to plant <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes;</hi> all which planting, and all, with the help of his Servants, will be eaſily effected by the middle of <hi>April.</hi> And then his beſt way is to ſet them to prepare more Ground, which he may plant with <hi>Plantane</hi>-Trees, and other things, (which he thinks he ſhall firſt want, for the enabling his Plantation to ſubſiſt of its ſelf) till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>February,</hi> which compleats the Year. In which time they may, with eaſe, prepare and plant about one or two and twenty Acres, and the Plantation will be able to live of its ſelf, for they will now be full of <hi>Potatoes</hi> and <hi>Corn,</hi> and within two Months of the new Year with <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> which, together with his ſtock of Hoggs and Fowls will ſufficiently furniſh him with Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his Servants.</p>
               <p>To improve this Ground, and plant the <hi>Cacao-Walk,</hi> he muſt, about the beginning of the next <hi>March,</hi> provide himſelf with five <hi>Negro</hi> men more, and as many Women, which will come to Two hundred pounds more: And that Month he muſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:199140:19"/> imploy all the hands he has in planting <hi>Cacao</hi>-Trees between all the Rows of <hi>Plantanes,</hi> which, by this time are grown to be ſix foot high, and, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June,</hi> he will have, beſides much other work done, the whole twenty one Acres, which were planted the year before with <hi>Cacao</hi>-Trees, which, in leſs than four years, will begin to bear Cods, and, in five years, produce compleat Crops, each Acre affording yearly to the Planter a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Weight of <hi>Cacao</hi>-Nuts, which is there worth about four Pounds <hi>per cent.</hi> ſo that the twenty one Acres, which are already planted and come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, are worth Eight hundred and forty Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi> And the whole Expence, together with Forty two Pounds fifteen Shillings more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for gathering and houſing them, amounts but to Five hundred Pounds, ſo that the profit will be very conſiderable.</p>
               <p>All the Work, already mentioned, will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in fifteen Months, and the remaining time, till the <hi>Cacaoes</hi> come to perfection, which will be ſomewhat better than four year, he may imploy in increaſing the Walk, building convenient Houſes, and making of Gardens for pleaſure: Or, if the ſmalneſs of his Stock will not permit him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear his Money till the <hi>Cacaoes</hi> come to bear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, he may fall to planting <hi>Ginger, Indico,</hi> or ſome ſuch kind of Commodity for preſent profit.</p>
               <p>And according to this Calculation the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſmaller or a larger Walk may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>There is in this Iſland a greater plenty of Cattel<note place="margin">Their Cattel.</note> than in moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America.</hi> Horſes ſo much abound there, that one of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </p>
               <p>In his third Voyage, he was ſhipwrack'd on this Coaſt,<note place="margin">Columbus ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd</note> and and driven to that extremity, that he was compelled to run his Ships on ground in a Port on the North-ſide of this Iſle, to which he gave the Name of <hi>Sancta Gloria;</hi> where, having laſhed them together, he lodged himſelf and his men on the Decks, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Land, in regard the Inhabitants were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous; and there had like to have ended his Life and his Diſcoveries together; the ungrateful <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> eſpecially the malicious Governor of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo,</hi> who hated him extreamly for his fortunate Succeſs, refuſed to ſend him any Relief, with a Deſign that he ſhould periſh in that ſad and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate condition; but having after two Months lying in that deplorable condition, obtained the good opinion of the Natives, he Landed, and finding the Ground fertile, and the Natives more Civil and Ingenious than what he had met withal in any of the other Iſlands, he reſolved to fall to Planting: In order whereunto, the Town called <hi>Metilla,</hi> was preſently begun by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but before it was far advanced, they deſerted it again, and ſetled ten Leagues further Weſt; where they met with a better Bay, whereunto they gave the Name of St. <hi>Annes;</hi> which it ſtill retains.</p>

               <p>Near this Place they built a handſom large Town, called <hi>Sevil,</hi> which hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: But finding in time that the South-ſide was more fruitful and pleaſant, about the Year 1590. the <hi>Spaniards</hi> forſook this likewiſe, and removed thither; where they built St. <hi>Jago;</hi>

               <p>More fatal to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was the next Attempt made on this Iſland; for <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cromwel<hi>'s</hi> Pre-</note> having turned out the <hi>Rump,</hi> uſurp'd the Title of <hi>Protector,</hi> and made peace with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at leiſure to try his Fortune in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and endeavour by a ſtrange kind of a ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Enterprize againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (with whom he was about this time highly offended, for giving entertainment to his injured Sovereign) to make his Name as terrible in thoſe remoter parts of the Earth, as his Treaſon and Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had rendered it in <hi>Europe.</hi> In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, having with great hurry and ſilence got ready a great Fleet, he ſent it under <hi>Penn,</hi> who was General at Sea, and <hi>Venables,</hi> who had the Command of the Land-Forces.</p>
               <p>Having after their leaving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, toucht at <hi>Barbados,</hi> they ſailed from thence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> without making any Declaration of War againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King, and

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> finding no oppoſition at their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thought themſelves Lords of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and began in their own thoughts to ſhare the Golden Mines among themſelves; which they had perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture effected, had not <hi>Venables</hi>'s covetous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and an inſatiable deſire to appropriate all to himſelf, by forbidding the Souldiers by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made at the Head of the Army to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any of that rich Booty, or preſume to kill any Cattle without leave, together with their tedious and diſconſolate March through thick Woods, and deep ſcalding Sands, ready to die with Thirſt, ſo damped their Spirits, and loſt their wonted Courage, that they became an eaſie prey to the wary <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who taking them at that advantage, and ſetting upon them at unawares,<note place="margin">The <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſappointed &amp; beaten.</note> deſtroyed them without reſiſtance, even till they were weary of killing, and Major Gen. <hi>Haines</hi> and between ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred more left both their Lives and their

               <p>Having thus fruſtrated their Expectations by their unadviſed Landing, and loſt all hope of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Town, they reſolve however not to loſe the whole Voyage without gaining ſomething from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and therefore next directed their Courſe to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> wherein was at that time but one only Town <hi>(viz.)</hi> St. <hi>Jago,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which Place dwelt all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that were in the Iſle, who kept their Slaves at ſeveral little Plantations in the Country, from whence they were continually ſupplied with ſtore of Fruits and Proviſions, which they luxuriouſly ſpent in their Houſes, that being a lazy People, who are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo proud, that they think it below them to take pains; deſigning nothing more but only to live in eaſe and plenty, their whole number, Slaves and all, not exceeding three Thouſand.</p>
               <p>Upon the Landing of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Army,<note place="margin">They take <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</hi>
                  </note> the Inhabitants of St <hi>Jago</hi> forſook the Town, and betook themſelves to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; but after divers Skirmiſhes and Surpriſals on both ſides, ſeeing but little hopes of regaining the Iſland, ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable among them got into <hi>Cuba,</hi> but were ſoon after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded back again by the Vice-roy of <hi>Alexico,</hi> with promiſes of a ſpeedy ſupply to be ſent after them. The Vice-roy's Promiſe was long before it was performed; and when the Succour came, it was but five hundred men, who refuſed to joyn with them, in regard they were ſo few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:199140:24"/> and by this time grown very ſickly, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelves at a place called St. <hi>Chereras,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to receive more Recruits; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> finding them out before they came, marched im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly againſt them, and defeated them, and ſo they did about thirty Companies of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers that arrived ſoon after; which bad Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſpair of ever regaining the Iſland. Whereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began now to form themſelves into a Body or Colony; ſome ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves in Plantations, and others ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Sea as Privateers, the better to ſecure themſelves againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and force them to conſent to a Peace, by their frequent annoying them, and ſeizing ſuch of their Ships as they met withal; in which they proved ſo very ſucceſsful, that <hi>Jamaica</hi> began to be much talked of, and had in great eſteem in <hi>England,</hi> and freſh Supplies of Men, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries were ſent them thence; and ſo by little and little it came to its preſent Potency, wherein His Majeſty will without doubt take care to preſerve and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, upon the following Conſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its being ſo large and capacious, that it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of entertaining a far greater number of People than any other Iſland enjoyed by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> in that part of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its being ſo ſeated in the heart of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Territories in <hi>America,</hi> that their Ships, as they come thither, and paſs from Port to Port, make this Iſle, or may be eaſily met with by thoſe Ships that ply upon the Coaſt; for all the Plate-Fleet, in their return from <hi>Carthagena,</hi> ſteer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and paſs by one of the ends of this Iſle, to recover <hi>Havana,</hi> which is the common Rendezvouz of the <hi>Spaniſh Armado,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:199140:24"/> before they ſail home through the Gulph of <hi>Florida.</hi> Nor indeed is there any other way; for the Voyage would be too unreaſonable long ſhould they turn it to the Windward of <hi>Hiſpaniola;</hi> by which means, beſides the great difficulty of its performance, they would loſe the benefit of uniting the Fleets from <hi>Mexicos Nombre de Dios,</hi> and other places, at their common Rendezvouz at <hi>Havana,</hi> wherein their greateſt Security lies; for from thence they ſail all home in company together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard <hi>Jamaica</hi> exceeds all the reſt of our Plantations in <hi>America</hi> for the goodneſs of thoſe Commodities proper to their ſeveral Colonies; and is beſides its being ſo profitable in furniſhing us with excellent Commodities, it likewiſe takes off abundance of our Manufactures, both of the product of this Kingdom, and ſuch as are brought us from Parts beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe it appears to be a place conſiderable enough to deſerve His Majeſties Care for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, not only by its ſubſiſting of its ſelf when firſt taken; but likewiſe by its increaſing its Potency and Grandeur, ſo that it will in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability become in a little time very profitable both to the King and Kingdom, and bring into His Majeſties Treaſury ſeveral hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Iſland being (when ſetled) of its ſelf able to carry on a War againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> ſhall require it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The conſiderable progreſs already made in the Settlement of this Iſle; nor can its diſtance be any real diſadvantage, ſince the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships are thereby employed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more Saylors, Ship-wrights, and other Tradeſmen, whoſe Livelihood depends upon trade
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199140:25"/> at Sea. Beſides, if it lay nearer, we could expect no ſuch Commodities as we receive from thence, in regard they are appropriated to that Clime. And it muſt certainly be a great advantage to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to have ſuch Merchandize within His own Dominions, as are both valued and needed by His Subjects and Neighbours, as the <hi>Cacao</hi> is, though it be at a diſtance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Coaſt of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribby-Iſlands</hi> are ſubject to ſuch Guſts of Wind, that Ships are often driven to put to Sea, and fly for ſhelter to ſome or other of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ports, where they were wont to be made Prizes of; but <hi>Jamaica,</hi> ſince it hath fallen into our hands, hath proved a convenient Harbour for ſuch Ships or Veſſels as are at any time thus diſtreſſed; which is an Argument ſufficient to perſwade His Majeſty to undertake its Support and Defence.</p>

               <p>It was firſt diſcovered in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt,<note place="margin">Its first Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> by Sir <hi>William Curteen,</hi> who return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing homewards from <hi>Fernambuck</hi> in <hi>Brazil,</hi> was driven by a ſtorm upon this Coaſt, and anchoring before the Iſle, he went with ſome of his Company aſhore, to inform himſelf of the Nature of the Place; which he found ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly overgrown with Woods, that they could find no plain or champaign ground ſit to inhabit, nor any ether Beaſts but Swine, which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> having formerly put on ſhore here, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with Proviſions in caſe they ſhould be caſt on that ſhoar by foul weather, had by this time multiplied abundantly, the Fruits and Roots that grew there ſerving them for food; ſo that the Natives of the adjacent Iſlands (for there were none in this) were uſed to come thither frequently to kill them.</p>
               <p>Having made this Diſcovery, and informed himſelf as well as he could of the Nature and Condition of the Iſland, he gave notice thereof
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:199140:27"/> to his Friends in <hi>England;</hi> from whence divers Ships were with all convenient ſpeed diſpatched thither; who, upon their Arrival, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the rendering the Iſland ſit for Habitation. In order to which, they cut down the Woods, and planted <hi>Potatoes</hi> and <hi>Maiz;</hi> which, together with the Swine which they found there, did but juſt keep Life and Soul together; for having as yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trade withal, Ships from <hi>England</hi> viſited them but ſlowly; ſo that they were oft-times driven to great extremities: But having about the year 1627. increas'd the number of its Inhabitants, and <hi>Tobacco, Indico, Cotton-wool, Fuſtick-wood,</hi> and the like, begun to grow there, and afford great increaſe, the Iſland began to gain more repute in <hi>England,</hi> and invited divers Ships, in hope of gain, to trade with them, exchanging divers ſorts of working-tools made of Iron and Steel, together with Cloth, Shirts, Drawers, Hoſe, Shoes, Hats, Servants, and other things which they needed, for <hi>Tobacco</hi> and other things which the Iſland pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. After which, they grew and increaſed wonderfully both in number and wealth; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when their Sugar-Canes were grown, and they had learned the Art of making Sugar.</p>
               <p>This Iſle is very hot, eſpecially for eight Months,<note place="margin">Its Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> and would be more inſupportable, were it not for the cool Briezes of Wind, which riſe with the Sun, and blow freſher as the Sun mounteth higher. And theſe Briezes blow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the North-Eaſt, except it be in the time of the <hi>Turnado,</hi> and then for an hour or two it chops into the South; but after returns to the ſame Point again. And it is obſerved, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the People do ſo much ſweat, yet they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199140:27"/> find not that faintneſs as with us in <hi>England</hi> in the Months of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>August;</hi> neither are they ſo thirſty, unleſs over-heated by exceſs of Labour, or drinking of ſtrong Liquors, which the People here are too much addicted unto, to their great hurt; which, if moderately taken, would be as a great preſervative to comfort and refreſh their inward parts, which are left cold and faint through their ſweating. Beſides, our Bodies being accuſtomed to colder Climates, our Spirits are not ſo vigorous without them in a moderate manner.</p>
               <p>This Iſle is not over-plentifully watered with Rivers or freſh Springs,<note place="margin">Its Waters.</note> there being but one that can appropriate to itſelf that Name, or rather a Lake which runs not far into the Land; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Inhabitants are not deſtitute thereof; for the Country lying low and level, there are ſeveral Pools or Ponds; and beſides they are ſupplied with Rain-water by having Wells and Ciſterns in their Houſes.</p>

But the two principal ſeaſons of the year for plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> but the <hi>Sugar-Canes</hi> are planted all the year round, the making of which is not only very chargeable, but alſo as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſubject to caſualties, either in the <hi>Boyling-houſe,</hi> with the Coppers and Furnaces,

               <p>The Dayes and Nights are almoſt throughout the year of an equal length, the Sun riſing and ſetting at ſix, except about <hi>October,</hi> and then there is ſome ſmall difference.</p>

               <p>But as for the Maſter-planters, Merchants Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and Strangers, their Fare is far otherwiſe, having their curious made Diſhes; as, <hi>Cuſtards, Cheeſe-Cakes, Tanſics,</hi> alſo, <hi>Sturgeon, Anchovies, Caveare, Botardo, Neats Tongues;</hi> beſides <hi>Poultrey, Fiſh, Fowl, Mutton, Beef, Kid, Pork, Beans, Peaſe,</hi> ſeveral Roots, and other good Diſhes.

               <p>This Iſland may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Maſters, Servants and Slaves;<note place="margin">The Diviſion of the Iſland.</note> the Maſters live in all affluence of Pleaſure and Delight.

To the <hi>Negro</hi>-Men they allow but three pair of Canvas Drawers, and to the Women, but three Petticoats.</p>
               <p>But for themſelves (eſpecially the better ſort) they are exceeding profuſe and coſtly.</p>
               <p>The Lodging of theſe poor Wretches is worſt of all; for having laboured all the day in ſo hot a Country, without any nouriſhing Diet, at night they muſt be content to lie hard, on nothing but a Board, without any Coverlet, in their Huts or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hog-ſties; but Chriſtian Servants are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better treated, being allowed Hamocks.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Sunday</hi> (which is the only day of Reſt, and ſhould be ſet apart for the Service of God) they employ either in the getting of the Bark of Trees, and making Ropes with it, which they truck away for Shirts, Drawers, and the like; or elſe ſpend the Day in Recreation, as Dancing and Wreſtling, which they much delight in, though
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:199140:31"/> they are no great Proficients in either; for in their Dancing they uſe Antick Actions, their hands ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more of motion than their feet, and their head than either; nor do the men and women dance together, but apart; the Muſick to which they dance being a ſort of Kettle-Drums, one bigger than another, which makes a ſtrange and various noiſe, but whether harmonious I leave to the Judgment of the Reader.</p>
               <p>The Servants, after five years, become Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Iſland, and then employ their time as may be moſt to their Advantage; but the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro-Slaves</hi> and their Children being in bondage for ever, are preſerved with greater care, and uſed with ſuch ſeverity, as occaſioned a great conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt their Maſters ſome years ſince; which was ſo cloſely carried, as no diſcovery was made till the day before it was to be acted, and then one of them, either failing of his Courage, or out of Love to his Maſter, diſcovered and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; for which, many of them were put to death, as a Terror to the reſt; who being ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, might prove dangerous, but that they are kept in ſuch ſtrict aw, and not ſuffered to touch or handle a Weapon; ſo that nothing is more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them than Gun-ſhot; and beſides, being of different Countries, do not underſtand one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Language; for in ſome of thoſe places in <hi>Africa,</hi> where petty Kingdoms are, who go to War againſt one another, the Priſoners that are taken on each ſide, they ſell unto and other <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Nations that come to traffick with them; yea, they ſell their Subjects, and ſome poor men their Servants, and ſometimes their Wives, for ſuch Traffick as our Merchants bring them; when they are brought hither, the Planters buy them

Religion they have none, yet ſeem to acknowledge a God, by looking up to Heaven for Revenge when they are wronged: One <hi>Negro</hi>-Woman being brought abed of two Children, her Husband provided a Cord to hang her, as falſe to him, but the Overſeer prevented it, by telling him, it was common with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women, and they liked them the better; yet if he were reſolved to hang her, he ſhould be hang'd himſelf by her, the fear of which hindered him.</p>

               <head>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLAND of St. <hi>CHRISTOPHERS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ST. <hi>CHRISTOPHERS,</hi> ſo named from <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> the firſt diſcover thereof, who finding it very pleaſant, gave it his own Name, which the ſhape of the Mountains likewiſe inclined him to, for on its upper part it hath as it were upon one of its ſhoulders another leſſer Mountain, as St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> is painted like a Giant, carrying our Saviour upon his back, like as it were a little Child. It is ſituated in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 17 degrees,<note place="margin">Situation.</note> and 25 minutes on this ſide the Line; in circuit about 75 Miles: the Land lies high in the midſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome very high Mountains, from which ſprings ſeveral Rivers, which oftentimes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Rains falling from the Mountains, are overflown, to the detriment of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The Soyl<note place="margin">The Soyl.</note> being light and ſandy, is apt to produce all ſorts of the Country-Fruits, Proviſion and Commodities, as <hi>Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Ginger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Iſle by reaſon of its ſeveral great and ſteep Mountains, between which are dreadful Rocks and Springs of hot and ſulphurous Water, with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199140:34"/> horrid Precipices and thick Woods, yea ſome Springs of Sulphur, which cauſes one of them to be called <hi>the Sulphurous Mountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is on the Sea-ſide a Salt-Pit, called <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſac;</hi> and not far from the Salt-Pit there is a ſmall <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of Land, which reacheth within a Mile and a half of the Iſland of <hi>Nevis</hi> and <hi>Mevis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iſland is placed exceeding delightful, and of a moſt delectable proſpect to the eye of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, for it is divided into ſeveral ſtages, from the uppermoſt whereof a man may take an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſant proſpect of all the Plantations and Gardens, which gently deſcend to the Sea-ſide, and in regard of the general aſcent of the Iſle, the lower ſtage or ſtory doth not debar the eye of the pleaſant proſpect of that which lieth at a remoter diſtance; and that which makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the more delectable in the ſeveral Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (which are bounded with Rows of Trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in their verdure) are the fair Houſes covered with glazed Slate.</p>
               <p>The whole Iſland is divided into four Quarters or Cantons; two whereof are poſſeſſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and two by the <hi>French,</hi> but ſo ſeparated, that People cannot go from one Quarter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other without paſſing over the Lands of one of the two Nations. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have more little Rivers in their Diviſion, the <hi>French</hi> more of the plain Countrey fit for Tillage. The <hi>Engilſh</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the <hi>French</hi> in number, but the <hi>French</hi> have four Forts; of which, one hath regular Works like a Citadel; that of moſt note commands the Haven, and is called <hi>Baſſe-Terre;</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only two, one commanding the great Haven, and the other a Deſcent not far from <hi>Pointe de Sable;</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:199140:34"/> and to prevent Differences between the two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, each of them have a Guard upon the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Diviſion, which is renewed every day.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have erected five fair Churches, well furniſhed with Pulpits, and Seats of excellent Joyners Work of precious Wood, the Miniſters being ſent thither by the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury;</hi> one of the Churches is at <hi>Sandy-Point,</hi> one at <hi>Palm-Tree,</hi> another near the <hi>Great Rood,</hi> and two at the Inlet of <hi>Cayoune,</hi> with many fair Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the ſame time; for in the Year 1625. Monſieur <hi>Deſnambuck,</hi> a <hi>French,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Warner</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, joyntly took poſſeſſion of Sir <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> on the ſame day, in the Names of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> their Maſters, that ſo they might have a place of ſafe Retreat, and a good Haven for the Ships of both Nations bound for <hi>America,</hi> as being well furniſhed with Proviſions, and therefore often vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſometimes left the Sick there to be looked to by the <hi>Caribeans,</hi> with whom they had made a Peace upon thoſe Terms.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Gentlemen, having thus taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Iſland, for the better eſtabliſhment of theſe Colonies, returned to their reſpective Countries, leaving ſome men in it to ſecure it; but ſuſpecting ſome private Intelligence between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for deſtroying all, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in their abſence, (to prevent which) they in one night rid their Hands of the moſt factious of that Nation, and ſoon after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all the reſt, who were got together in ſeveral Bodies, and ſtood upon their Guard, to retire to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199140:35"/> ſome other Iſlands, and leave that to their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. After this, they returned home, where their Conqueſt and Proceeding being approved of by the Kings their Maſters, they returned with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of Men, in the quality of Governors and Lieutenants under the Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and having divided the Iſland according to their firſt Agreement; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having plentiful Proviſions from <hi>London,</hi> proſpered much more than the <hi>French,</hi> who wanted neceſſary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French,</hi> beſides their ſeveral Habitations diſperſed up and down in their Quarters, have at <hi>Baſſe-Terre</hi> (near the Haven where Ships lie at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor) a Town of a good bigneſs, whoſe Houſes are well built, of Brick, Free-ſtone and Timber, where the Merchants have their Store-houſes, and is well inhabited by Tradeſmen, and are well ſerved with ſuch Commodities both for the Back and Belly, together with Utenſils for their Houſes and Plantations, as they have occaſion for, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſuch Commodities which are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Iſland.</p>
               <p>Here is a fair and large Church, as alſo a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hall, for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. Here is alſo a very fair Hoſpital, built by the General, for ſuch People as cannot get Cure at their Houſes; where they are well maintained, and attended by Phyſitians for the recovery of their healths. Here is alſo a ſtately Caſtle, being the Reſidence of the Governour, being moſt pleaſantly ſeated at the foot of a high Mountain, not far from the Sea, having ſpacious Courts, delightful Walks and Gardens, which cauſeth a curious Proſpect.</p>

This Navy conſiſted of twenty four great Ships of Burden, and fifteen Frigots, who firſt ſeized ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships that were lying at Anchor near the Iſle of <hi>Mevis,</hi> and from thence came and caſt Anchor in the Road of St. <hi>Chriſtophers,</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Diviſion, and the Forts of both Colonies being not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſtand out a Siege, being unfurniſhed with Ammunition and Proviſions, not being able to withſtand ſo great an Army if all the Forces of the Nations had been in conjunction, which made it a very great diſcouragement to them; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the Enemy ſhould not boaſt they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed their deſigns without Blows, they made a very vigorous oppoſition; but being overcome by number, the <hi>French</hi> forſook the Iſland; <hi>Deſnam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck</hi> embarking all his Men in certain Ships which happened to be in the Haven. Upon this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Quarters of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were put into very great diſorder, and in continual expectation that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would fall upon them; ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eſcape by Sea, or hide themſelves in the Mountains; but others, being more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, ſent Deputies to Don <hi>Frederick,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an accommodation; but all the Anſwer they received, was an expreſs Command immediately to depart the Iſland, or to be treated with that rigour which the Law of Arms allowed toward ſuch as wrongfully poſſeſs that which belongs not to them; and to ſpeed their departure, he order'd thoſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships ſhould be reſtored to them that were taken at <hi>Mevis,</hi> wherein inſtantly they ſhould imbark for <hi>England;</hi> and becauſe it was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199140:36"/> impoſſible thoſe Veſſels ſhould contain ſo great a number, he permitted the reſt to continue in the Iſle till they had opportunity of Tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Upon which, Don <hi>Frederick</hi> weighed Anchor; but aſſoon as the Fleet was departed, thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were left, began to rally, and took a reſolution to carry on the Settlement of their Colony; during which Tranſaction at St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> who went to Sea, having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many Inconveniences, were forced to put in at the Iſlands of St. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> but looking on them as Deſarts in compariſon of the Places they had left, and being deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the condition of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there, ſent one of their Ships to St. <hi>Chriſtophers;</hi> who returning, gave them an Account that the Enemy was gone, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> couragiouſly employed in re-building, planting and repairing Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This unexpected good News revived their decayed hopes, and perſuaded them to a ſpeedy return; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony with conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from <hi>London,</hi> for that time grew very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, peopling not only this Place, but ſending new Plantations from hence to <hi>Barbuda, Montſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, Antego,</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> which are grown very numerous and famous for the Trade of the rich Commodities they are furniſhed with, as well as this curious Iſland, whoſe chiefeſt Trade is <hi>Sugar,</hi>

               <p>There is likewiſe in this Iſland an Inſect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Snail, called <hi>a Soldier,</hi> but have no ſhells proper to themſelves; therefore, to ſecure their weak bodies againſt the Air, and the aſſaults of other Creatures, they get ſhelter in ſuch ſhells as they find moſt convenient, which, for the moſt part, is that of <hi>Perriwinkles,</hi> but as they grow big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they ſhift their ſhells, and go into bigger; their Foot, or Inſtrument, is like a Crab's-claw, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they cloſe the entrance of their ſhells, for the ſecurity of their bodies: if they be ſet neer the fire, they forſake their Quarters, but if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them, to get it again, they go in back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; when they deſign to change quarters, which they are very ſubject to do, there happens a furious Ingagement, managed with their claſping Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'till the ſtrongeſt gets poſſeſſion, which he enjoys very peaceably during his pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:199140:40"/>
               <p>There is likewiſe found in theſe parts a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Spider, which when ſhe ſpreads her legs, is ſo large, that ſhe takes up above the breadth of a man's hand, whoſe body conſiſts of two parts, one round, and the other flat, leſſer at one end, like a Pigeons Egg, with a hole in the back, which is as it were their Navel; it is armed with two ſharp Tuſhes, which are very ſolid, black, and ſhining; ſo that there are ſome that make uſe of them for Tooth-pickers, being firſt ſet in Gold, which are counted to have a power of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from corruption and pain, rubbing the places therewith; when they come to be old, they are clothed with a ſwarthy Down, which is as ſoft as Velvet: they have about ten Feet, each having four joynts, and at the ends armed with a black, hard Horn. They ſhift their old Skins every Year, and alſo their Tuſhes; they feed on Flies, and ſuch Vermin; and in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it hath been obſerved, that their Webs are of ſuch a ſtrength, that ſmall Birds can hardly get themſelves from it.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a very lovely Animal,<note place="margin">Animals.</note> called <hi>the Fly-catcher,</hi> it hath four Legs, and is of a very ſmall ſize, ſome of them ſeeming to be covered with fine gold or ſilver <hi>Brocado,</hi> and ſeveral with a mixture of Green, Gold, with other very delightful Colours; they are ſo very familiar, that they will come boldly into Rooms, doing no miſchief, but on the contrary, clear them of Flies, and ſuch kind of Vermin, which they perform with ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of flight, that the cunning of Huntſmen is not to be compared to it, for he generally lies down where he expects the Fly to come, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eye always fixed thereon, putting his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:199140:40"/> head into as many different poſtures, as the Fly removes places, and ſtanding upon his fore-feet, gapes after it, his little mouth being half open, as if he had ſwallowed it in hope; and if one come near him, and make never ſo great a noiſe, it will not diſturb him, and at laſt, having an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, he goes direct on his prey, very rarely miſſing of it. They are ſo extraordinary tame, that they will come at Dinner time upon the very Table, and endeavour to catch Flies upon their Hands or Clothes, being extraordinary neat and clean things: the Eggs they lay are as big as Peaſe, which they leave to be hatched by the Sun, covering of it firſt with Sand: they are no ſooner killed, but all their beauty vaniſheth, and they become pale. It may be counted a ſort of <hi>Camelion,</hi> partaking of the colour of thoſe things on which it makes its ordinary reſidence, for being about Palm-Trees, it is green, and about Orange-Trees, yellow, and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Palm-Worm</hi> is remarkable from its infinite number of Feet, which are like Briſtles under his Body, which, if purſued, help him to creep with incredible ſwiftneſs. It's half a foot long, the upper part covered with ſwarthy Scales, which are hard, and joynted one within another, like the Tiles of a Houſe; but the moſt danger in this Creature is, that he hath a kind of Claw, both in Head and Tail, wherewith he pierces ſo home, and poyſons the wound he makes therewith, that for the ſpace of 24 hours the party feels great pain.</p>
               <p>There was ſeveral years ſince brought from thence a Bird about the bigneſs and ſhape of a Swallow, only two large Feathers on the Tail, a little ſhorter, and the Beak turned down,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199140:41"/> like a Parrot, and its Feet like Ducks; its only black under the Belly, ſomething white, like our Swallows; in ſhort, it is ſo very like them, that it may be called the Swallow of <hi>America.</hi>

               <p>This Iſle doth abound with Fiſh of all ſorts,<note place="margin">Their Fiſh.</note> amongſt which the <hi>Shark-fiſh</hi> deſerves remark; it is a kind of Sea-Wolf, or Sea-Dog, the moſt devouring of all Fiſhes, and the moſt greedy of Mans-fleſh, and therefore exceeding dangerous to thoſe that ſwim; he lives altogether by prey, and generally follows Ships, to feed on the filth caſt out of them into the Sea. Theſe Monſters ſeem yellow in the water; ſome of them are of a vaſt length and bigneſs, inſomuch that they are able to cut a man in two at one bite; their Skin ſo rough, that they polliſh Wood with it, inſtead of Files; their Heads are flat, and the opening of their Mouths is under their Snout, ſo that they are forced to turn their Bellies almoſt upward when they ſeize their prey; their Teeth are very ſharp and broad, jagged like a Saw, ſome having three or four ranks in each Jaw-bone, they lye within their Gums, but ſufficiently appear when there is occaſion. Theſe cruel Sea-Dogs are attended by two or three ſmall Fiſhes, and ſometimes more, which go before them with ſuch ſwiftneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, that they go either forward or ſtay as he doth: The Meat of him is not good, but the Brains are found to be good and profitable againſt the Stone and Gravel.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe found another ravenous Sea-Monſter, called the <hi>Becune,</hi> a dreadful enemy to Man-kind, in ſhape like a Pike, being about ſeven or eight foot long; he lives by prey, and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly faſtens, like a Blood-hound, on the Men he perceives in the water.

               <p>There are another ſort of <hi>Becunes,</hi> by ſome cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sea Wood-Cocks, their Beaks being ſomewhat like a Wood-Cock's Bill, only the upper part much longer than the lower, and moves both Jaws with like facility, ſome of them being four foot long, and twelve inches broad near the Head, which is ſomewhat like a Swines, with two large Eyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſhining; he hath two Fins on the ſides, and under the Belly a large Plume, riſing higher, like a Cock's Comb, reaching from Head to Tail: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a long ſolid Beak, it hath two ſorts of Horns, hard and black, and about a foot and a half in length, which hang down under his Throat, and are particular to this kind of Fiſh, and theſe he can eaſily hide in a hollow place under his Belly, which ſerves them for a ſheath; it hath no Scales, but a rough, black Skin on the Back, and the Meat is eatable.</p>
               <p>Another Fiſh, found about theſe Iſlands, is called the <hi>Sea <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchin,</hi> or <hi>Hedge-Hog,</hi> and rightly deſerves that Name; it is round as a Ball, and full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſharp Prickles, which makes it to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by ſeveral it is called the <hi>Armed Fiſh;</hi> they are ſent as Preſents to thoſe that are curious, to hang in their Cloſets.</p>
               <p>There is great plenty of moſt ſorts of Wild Fowl, and not wanting in Veniſon and Tame Cattel. The Commodities this Iſland affords are <hi>Sugar, Indico, Ginger,</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea-Parrots</hi> are very admirable, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſparkling and beautiful Eyes, the Ball whereof being as clear as Criſtal, incloſed within a circle as green as an Emerald, of which colour are the Scales on their Backs; they have no Teeth, but Jaws above and below of a ſolid bone, very
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:199140:42"/> ſtrong, of the ſame colour with their Scales, and divided into little compartiments, very beautiful to the Eye; they live on Shell-fiſh, and they cruſh, as between two Milſtones, with their hard Jaws, Oyſters, Muſcles, and other Shell-fiſh, to get out the Meat. They are an excellent ſort of Fiſh to eat, and ſo great, that ſome of them have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward of twenty pound.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dorado,</hi> by ſome called the <hi>Sea-Bream,</hi> by others the <hi>Amber-fiſh,</hi> is alſo common in theſe parts; ſo called, becauſe in the water the Head ſeems to be of a green guilt, and the reſt of the Body as yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as Gold. It takes great pleaſure and delight in following of Ships, but being ſo ſwift, is very hard to take, being extraordinary well furniſhed for ſwimming, having the fore-part of the Head ſharp; the Back briſtles with prickles reaching to the Tail, which is forked; two Fins on each ſide the Head, and as many under the Belly, and the whole Body rather broad than big; all which give him a ſtrange command of the water: he is as good Meat as a <hi>Trout</hi> or <hi>Salmon;</hi> they are caught only with a piece of white Linnen tyed to the Hook.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199140:43"/> Murrey-down, chequered with green, yellow, and a pale blew, which reaches waving down to his Back, the Eye-lids being white, and the Apple of the Eye of a moſt excellent yellow, and red like a Ruby ſet in Gold; it hath upon the Head a Tuft, or Cap of Feathers, of a Vermilion red, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling like a lighted Coal, which is incompaſſed by other ſmaller Feathers of a Pearl colour. It is about the bigneſs of a Pheaſant, and exceeding kind and familiar with its friends, but as ſevere to its enemies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Flamot</hi> is an exceeding large and beautiful Bird, about the bigneſs of a wild Gooſe; his Beak is like a Spoon, his Legs and Neck very long, ſo that his Body is three foot from the ground, their Feathers being white when they are young, after Murrey, and when they come to be old, of a bright Carnation, being rarely ſeen but in great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and their hearing and ſmelling is ſo perfect, that they ſmell the Huntſmen and Fire-arms at a large diſtance, and therefore, for fear of ſurprize, they make their aboad in the midſt of the Fens, one of them being always Continel while they are ſearching about the waters for a livelihood; as ſoon as he hears the leaſt noiſe, or ſees a man, he takes his flight, and makes a great cry, for a ſignal to the reſt to follow him: when the Huntſmen take them, they get the wind of them, that they may not ſmell the Powder, and covering themſelves with an Ox-hide, creep on their hands and feet 'till they get ſuch an opportunity that they are ſure of killing them.</p>

               <p>THE Iſland of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> lies in the latitude of 16 degrees North from the Line, and is about 24 Miles in length, and 18 in breadth,<note place="margin">Situation.</note> wherein are ſeveral high Mountains, having between them exceeding fruitful Plains, yielding good ſtore of Sugar Canes, which grow naturally without plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: It is well water'd with Rivers, and hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral convenient Harbours and Bays for Shipping. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have here ſome ſettlement, but are not very powerful, it being more populous of <hi>Caribeans,</hi> than of any poſſeſſed by them, who have here many fair Villages, where they dwell exceeding pleaſant, without the leaſt diſturbance; and though they are jealous of thoſe Strangers that live near them, and keep Guard when they come upon their Roads, yet they do not deny <hi>Caſſavy</hi> Bread, Water, Fruits, and other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions growing in their Country, to them that want them, taking in exchange Wedges, Hooks, and other Implements of Iron, which they much eſteem. Their ſimplicity is very remarkable in ſeveral things, as in admiring our Fire-Arms, but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:199140:44"/> eſpecially Fire-Locks, to which they ſee no fire put, as to Muskets, and therefore believe <hi>Maboya,</hi> or the Devil, ſets them on fire; they believe when the Moon is Eclipſed, the Devil eats her; they daunce all night, making a noiſe with Gourds, wherein are many pebble ſtones; when they ſmell any evil ſcent, they cry, <hi>Maboya,</hi> or the Devil, <hi>is here, let us be gone from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time ſince, moſt of the <hi>Caribeans</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Gun-powder was the Seed of ſome Hearb, inſomuch that ſome of them ſowed it in their Gardens. They never make uſe of Salt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it very prejudicial to health, and when they ſee Chriſtians uſe it, cry, <hi>Compere, thou haſtneth thy own death;</hi> but inſtead thereof, they ſeaſon all things with <hi>American</hi> Pepper: Neither do they eat Swines-fleſh, for this ſimple reaſon, leaſt they ſhould have ſmall Eyes like that Beaſt, which they judge the greateſt deformity; nor Tortoiſe or Turtle, leſt they ſhould participate of its lazineſs and ſtupidity. They have no notion of a Deity, ſo that neither Prayers, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, or any Exerciſe or Aſſembly whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is to be found amongſt them; but ſay, the Earth is their indulgent Mother, who furniſhes them with all things neceſſary to Life. If any diſcourſe to them about God, and the Myſteries of our Religion, they hearken attentively, but in the end, anſwer as it were in jeſt, <hi>Friend, thou art very eloquent and ſubtile, I wiſh I could talk as well as thee.</hi> Nay, they ſometimes ſay, That if they ſhould be perſwaded by ſuch Diſcourſes, their Neighbours would laugh at them. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Caribean</hi> being at work on a <hi>Sunday, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Montel</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Friend, He that made Heaven and Earth will be angry with thee for working
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:199140:44"/> on this Day, for he hath appointed this Day for his Service: And I,</hi> replied the <hi>Savage</hi> very bluntly, <hi>am already very angry with him; for thou ſay'st he is Master of the World and the Seaſons, He it is therefore that hath forborn to ſend Rain in due time, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Drougth, hath cauſed my Manioc and my Potatoes to rot in the ground; now ſince he hath treated me ſo ill, I will work on every</hi> Sunday <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to vex him:</hi> A pregnant Example of the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of this wretched People.</p>
               <p>They have a natural ſentiment of ſome Divinity or Superior Power, that hath its Reſidence in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which they ſay is content to enjoy quietly the delights of his own felicity, without being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the ill actions of Men; and is endued with ſo great goodneſs, as not to take any Revenge, even of his Enemies, from whence they render Heaven neither Honour nor Adoration, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its liberality and long-ſufferance, an effect either of its weakneſs or indifference towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, believing that there are a number of Good and Evil Spirits, the Good being their Gods, and every one imagines he has one particularly deſign'd for his Conduct, yet will not acknowledge them Creators of the World: And when the Chriſtians tell them, we adore that God who made Heaven and Earth, and cauſeth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our nouriſhment; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is true, thy God hath made the Heaven and Earth, of <hi>France,</hi> (or ſome other Country which they name) and cauſes the Wheat to grow there; but our God has made our Country, and cauſes our Manioc to grow. This Manioc is a Root of a ſmall Tree or Shrub, whereof the <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> make Bread. When they are recovered of ſome Diſeaſe, they ſet a little Table at the end of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:199140:45"/> their Hutts, and upon it their Offerings, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Adoration or Prayers; yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate their Falſe Gods, when they deſire his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; but this is done by their Prieſts, and that upon four occaſions. 1. To Demand Revenge. 2. To be Healed of Diſeaſes. 3. To know the Event of their Wars. 4. To invocate them to carry away their Great Devil, or <hi>Maboya,</hi> for they never pray to him: His Invocation is by Singing ſome words, and burning Tobacco, the ſcent whereof is ſo pleaſant, that it makes this little Devil appear. And when their ſeveral Prieſts call upon their ſeveral Gods together, as they ſpeak, theſe Gods, or rather Devils, rail, quarrel, and ſeem to fight with each other. Theſe Daemons ſhelter themſelves ſometimes in the Bones of dead Men, taken out of the Graves, and wrapt in Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and thereby give Oracles, ſaying, it is the Soul of the deceaſed Perſon; they make uſe of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerers wrapping up theſe Bones with ſomething that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Devils do alſo ſometimes enter into the Bodies of Women, and ſpeak by them, clearly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all queſtions demanded: After the Boy or Prieſt is retir'd, the Devil ſtirs the Veſſels, and makes a noiſe with his Jaws, as if he were eating and drinking the Preſents prepared for him, but the next day they find he hath not medled with any thing. Theſe poor Wretches complain that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Maboya</hi> beats them ſeverely, which though ſome impute to melancholy Dreams, yet other Perſons of Quality and exquiſite Knowledge, who have lived long in St. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Iſland, do affirm, that the Devils do effectually beat them, and they often ſhew on their Bodies the viſible marks of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:199140:45"/> blows they have received: Sometimes they make <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid complaint</hi> of his Cruelty, ſaying, That of late he is mightily incenſed againſt the <hi>Caribeans,</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Europeans</hi> happy that their <hi>Maboya</hi> doth not beat them.

               <p>It is this moſt cruel and bloody Spirit that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to act ſuch barbarous Cruelty upon thoſe they take in War, in relating which, I had need dip my Pen in Blood, being to draw ſuch a Picture which muſt needs raiſe horror in the Beholder. In which there appears nothing but Inhumanity, Barbariſm and Rage, to ſee Rational Creatures devouring thoſe of the ſame kind with them, and filling themſelves with their fleſh and blood, a thing which Pagans heretofore thought ſo full of Execration, that they imagined the Sun withdrew himſelf, becauſe he would not give <hi>light</hi> to ſuch <hi>bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Banquets.</hi> When theſe <hi>Cannibals,</hi> or <hi>Eastern</hi> Men, (here their proper Names) have brought home a Priſoner of War of the <hi>Arovagnes,</hi> he belongs of right to him who either ſeized him in Fight, or took him running away; being brought to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:199140:46"/> this Iſland, he keeps him ſafe in his Houſe, and after he has made him faſt four or five days, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces him upon ſome Solemn Day of Debauch, to ſerve for a Publick Sacrifice, to the mortal hatred of his Country-men toward that Nation. If any of their Enemies die on the place of Battel, they eat them there; they deſign only for Slavery the young Maids and Women taken in War; they have taſted of all the Nations that frequent them, and upon experience affirm, that the <hi>French</hi> are the moſt tender, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the hardeſt of digeſtion; but now they feed on no Chriſtians at all.</p>
               <p>They abſtain from ſeveral Cruelties formerly uſed before they killed their Enemies, for now they think it enough to diſpatch them at a blow or two with a Club, and afterwards cut them into pieces, and having boyl'd them, they devour them: They heretofore put them to ſeveral torments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gave them the mortal blow, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Relation they themſelves have given to thoſe who have been curious, from their own mouths. Thoſe who have been ſo unfortunate in the time of War, to fall as Priſoners into their Hands, are not ignorant of the cruel torments they deſign againſt them, and therefore to arm themſelves with conſtancy, and to expreſs how generous a People the <hi>Arovagues</hi> are, march very chearfully to the place of Execution, being neither bound nor dragged thereto, but preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a mild and ſteady countenance before the whole Aſſembly, which they know deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as their Death, and expecting their abuſes and bitter diſcourſes, prevent them in theſe tetms <q>I know well enough upon what account you have brought me to this Place, I doubt not

               <p>The Great Soul of our <hi>Arovagues</hi> was not only in his Lips, but likewiſe ſhewed it alſo in the effects which follow his Bravado; for after the Company had a while endured his arrogant defiance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

After they had thus ſported a long time with the poor wretch, and growing weary of inſulting and out-braving by his conſtancy, which ſeemed ſtill the ſame, one of them came, and with one blow diſpatch'd him with his Club. This is the Uſage wherewith the <hi>Caribeans</hi> heretofore treated their Priſoners of War, but now they think it enough to put them to a ſpeedy death.

               <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE Iſland of <hi>DOMINICA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Iſland of <hi>Dominica</hi> is ſituated in the Latitude of 15 Degrees,<note place="margin">Its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 30 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and about 12 Leagues in length, and 8 in breadth. On the Weſt-ſide is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Harbour for Ships. It is very mountainous in the midſt, which incompaſſes an inacceſſable bottom, where, from the tops of certain Rocks, may be ſeen an infinite number of Dragons, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and other moſt venomous and dreadful creatures, whom none dares come near, yet there are many Fertile Villages, producing ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but chiefly Tobacco, which is planted by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but the Natives, which are <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> and very barbarous, doth much hinder the coming of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſettle there; for the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribeans</hi> are very populous in it, and have a long time entertained thoſe who come to viſit them with a ſtory of a vaſt monſtrous Serpent that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented that bottom; affirming, that there was on its Head a very ſparkling Stone, like a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle of ineſtimable price, which it commonly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:199140:48"/> covered with a thin moving skin, like a Mans eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but when he drank or ſported himſelf in that deep bottom, it was fully and plainly diſcovered, the Rocks and all about the place receiving a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful luſtre from the fire, iſſuing out of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Crown.</p>
               <p>They are generally very friendly with the <hi>French,</hi> and upon the approach of any of their Ships, ſeveral <hi>Canoes,</hi> with three or four <hi>Indians</hi> in each of them, immediately meet them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them to the Havens, where they may ſafely Anchor. And having preſented the Captain and others Officers with the choiceſt of thoſe Country-Fruits, they commonly bring them, they offer the reſt in exchange, for Fiſhing-hooks, and other ſuch kind of trifles, which they account precious. But to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they have a great averſion, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as is reported, upon this occaſion: Some evil-minded <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> under the Flags of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having, by pretended kindneſs and little gifts, gotten divers of them on board their Ships, and made them merry with <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> and <hi>Brandy,</hi> which they love extreamly, they ſuddenly hoiſted up ſail, and carried away thoſe poor, innocent People, who expected no ſuch Treachery, from ſuch pretended Friends. And although the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have indeavoured to ſatisfie them, yet ſo impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable is their temper, that they can't be perſwaded to forget or forgive the injury; but, next to the <hi>Arovagues,</hi> a People on the Continent, they hate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as their worſt Enemies: and to ſuch an height of envy hath this Action exaſperated them, that they hate the very Language, and can't indure to hear it ſpoken, and if a <hi>French man,</hi> or any other at peace with them, happen, through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, to make uſe of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Expreſſion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:199140:48"/> in diſcourſing with them, he runs the hazard of contracting his envy for ever upon himſelf. Nor do they fail, when they find opportunity, to make incurſions into <hi>Montſerrat, Antego,</hi> and other of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements, plundering and burning down their Houſes, and carrying away ſuch Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children as they can get into their hands by ſurpriſe, but do not eat them as they do the <hi>Arovagues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They can't indure to be called <hi>Cannibals:</hi> they do eat the fleſh of their enemies, which they ſay is to gratifie their revenge, and not out of any delicacy they find in the meat. They are for the moſt part of a good tractable diſpoſition, and ſuch enemies to ſeverity, that thoſe of them that fall into the hands of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> or any other Nation, if their Maſters treat them with rigour, they die out of pure grief. They deſpiſe Riches, and often reproach the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> for their avarice and exceſſive deſire of Wealth, not only for themſelves, but thoſe that come after them too, ſince the Earth will find a ſufficiency for all men, who will take pains to manure it; telling them, that they never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and torture themſelves with cares for thoſe things whereby their Lives are preſerved; and yet, for any thing they can ſee to the contrary, they are fatter in fleſh and much happier in the whole courſe of their Lives, than thoſe that do always eat and drink of the beſt. And, to ſay the truth, they are a People that live without ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vexation, or diſquieting themſelves with a fruitleſs thoughtfulneſs about future Events; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no deſire of acquiring Wealth and Honour, ſlighting Gold and Silver as things not worth the valuing, proteſting they can't but wonder we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199140:49"/> ſhould eſteem, ſo much as we do, ſeeing we are ſo well furniſhed with things much more valuable and beautifuller, as they eſteem Glaſs, Criſtal, and the like to be. When they ſee any of the Chriſtians are perplex'd, they cry, <hi>Compeer,</hi> which ſignifies Friend or Goſſip, <hi>How miſerable dost thou make thy Life, by expoſing thy ſelf to ſuch long and dangerous Voyages, oppreſſing thy ſelf with cares and the inordinate deſire of getting Wealth, which puts thee to all this trouble, and is the occaſion of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inconveniencies thou every day meetest withal, from which we are wholly free. And that which yet ſeems to me much ſtranger, is, your being no leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted about the Goods you have already gotten, than you are about thoſe you deſire to obtain. Thou art al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fear lest ſomebody ſhould rob thee by Land or by Sea, or that thy Goods ſhould ſuffer Shipwreck, or thou ſhouldest ſuffer dammage by their coming too late for the Market. And by this means thou growest old before thy time, thy Hair turns grey, thy Body waxes lean thy Forehead wrinkled, a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies attend thy Perſon, and as many afflictions ſurround thy Heart, and hurries thee with the greater ſpeed to thy Grave. What a ſtrange thing 'tis, that thou canst not content thy ſelf with what thy own Countrey produces, and contemn Riches, as thou ſeest us do. Or tell me, Doth that Wealth which you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians purſue with ſo much eagerneſs, tend to your advancement in holineſs? doth it prevent your dying, or can you carry any of it into that Eternity you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times talk of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes they will upbraid the <hi>Europeans</hi> with manifeſt injuſtice, in invading their Country; <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving driven us from</hi> Mevis, Montſerrat, Antego, <hi>&amp;c. none of all which did by any pretence of right belong to you, and threatning ſtill to take away what is left;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:199140:49"/> What ſhall become of the poor</hi> Caribeans! <hi>Whither ſhall we fly next for Habitations? would you have us go and dwell in the Sea with the Fiſhes?</hi> Which kind of Diſcourſes ſhew them not to be ſo <hi>Savage</hi> as thoſe of St. <hi>Vincents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are great enemies to thieving, and live without diſtruſt of each other, frequently lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Houſes and Plantations without any to look to them; but if they chance to loſe any thing, though but a little Knife, they will weep and grieve a Week after; and if any Chriſtians live near, they preſently ſuſpect them, and ſay, <hi>Some Chriſtian hath been here.</hi> And in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to any of the <hi>French</hi> Governours, this is commonly the firſt: <hi>Thy Mariners</hi> (for ſo they call all ſtrangers) <hi>have taken away a Knife</hi> (or ſome ſuch ſmall trifle) <hi>out of my Cottage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are a People linked in one common intreſt, and love each other extreamly, ſo that very rarely any difference ariſeth amongſt them; but if they are by chance offended, though it be by one of their own People, they ſeldom ever forget it, but ſtudy all imaginable ways of revenge, and when their Sorcerers tell them ſuch an one hath done them the Miſchief that happens to them, they watch all opportunities to kill him, crying out, <hi>He hath bewitched me, I will be revenged on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They bear great reſpect to ancient people, the younger ſort complying in all things with their ſentiments and wills. Their Youths have no converſation either with their Maids or married Women, and are generally leſs amorous than thoſe of the Female Sex, though both are very chaſt, a Vertue worthy admiration in a barbarous People that go naked. But, by the pernicious
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199140:50"/> Examples the Chriſtians have ſet them, they are now grown ſomewhat more looſe. They are great lovers of Neatneſs, which is not very uſual among <hi>Savages,</hi> for if a man ſhould but eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their Garden where their <hi>Potatoes</hi> grow, they will forſake them.</p>

               <p>The conveniency of Situation, temperature of Air, and fertility of Soyl is ſuch, that there is no leſs then ſeven conſiderable Towns, <hi>viz. Shrewsbury,</hi>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>For this Province, the general Condition of it take as followeth:</head>
                  <p>THE Country itſelf in its Soil, Air, Water, Seaſons, and Product, both Natural and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, is not to be deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>The Land contains divers ſorts of Earth; as Sand, yellow and black,<note place="margin">Its Soil.</note> poor and rich: Alſo Gravel, both loomy and duſty; and in ſome places a faſt, fat Earth, like to our beſt Vales in <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially by Inland-Brooks and Rivers; God, in his wiſdom, hath ordered it ſo, that the Advantages of the Country are divided, the Back-Lands being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally three to one richer than thoſe that lye by Navigable Waters; we have much of another Soil, and that is a black, Haſle-Mould, upon a ſtony or rocky bottom.</p>
                  <p>The Air<note place="margin">Its Air.</note> is ſweet and cleer, the Heavens ſerene, like the South-Parts of <hi>France,</hi> rarely over-caſt, and as the Woods come by numbers of people to be more cleared, that itſelf will refine.</p>
                  <p>The Waters<note place="margin">Its Waters.</note> are generally good, for the Rivers and Brooks have moſtly gravel and ſtony bottoms, and in number hardly credible. We have alſo Mineral Waters, that operate in the ſame manner with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:199140:57"/> and <hi>North-hall,</hi> not two Miles from <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Seaſons of the Year, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,<note place="margin">Its Climate.</note> by God's goodneſs, now lived over the coldeſt and hotteſt, that the oldeſt liver in the Province can remember, I can ſay ſomething to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> underſtanding. Firſt, Of the Fall, for then I came in: I found it from the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> as we have it uſually in <hi>September,</hi> or rather like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mild Spring. From <hi>December,</hi> to the beginning of the Month called <hi>March,</hi> we had ſharp, froſty weather; not foul, thick, black weather, as our North-Eaſt Winds bring with them in <hi>England,</hi> but a Sky as clear as in Summer, and the Air dry, cold, piercing, and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more Clothes than in <hi>England.</hi> The reaſon of this cold is given from the great Lakes that are fed by the Fountains of <hi>Canada.</hi> The Winter before was as mild, ſcarce any Ice at all; while this for a few days froze up our great River <hi>Delaware.</hi> From that Month, to the Month called <hi>June,</hi> we enjoyed a ſweet Spring, no Guſts, but gentle Showers and a fine Sky. Yet this I obſerve, that the Winds here, as there, are moſt inconſtant Spring and Fall, upon that turn of Nature, than in Summer or Winter. From thence, to this preſent Month, which ended the Summer, (commonly ſpeaking) we have had extraordinary heats, yet mitigated ſometimes by cold Breezes. The Wind that rules the Summer-ſeaſon, is the South-Weſt; but Spring, Fall, and Winter, 'tis rare to want the wholeſom North-Weſtern ſeven days together; and whatever Miſts, Fogs, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, foul the Heavens by Eaſterly or Southerly Winds, in two hours time are blown away; the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199140:57"/> one is always followed by the other. A Remedy that ſeems to be a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of Trees yet ſtanding, being liable to retain Miſts and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, and yet not one quarter ſo thick as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                  <p>The natural product of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Vegetables,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vegetables.</note> is Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers; the Trees of moſt Note, are, the Black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Cheſnut, Poplar, Gum-wood, Hickery, Saſſafras, Aſh, Beech, and Oak of divers ſorts, as Red, White and Black; <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cheſnut and Swamp, the moſt durable of all; of all which there is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for uſe of Man.</p>
                  <p>The Fruits<note place="margin">Fruits.</note> that I find in the Woods, are, the white and black Mulberry, Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Walnut, Plums, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries, and Grapes of divers ſorts, the great red Grape, (now Ripe) called by ignorance, the <hi>Fox</hi>-Grape (becauſe of the reliſh it hath with unskilful palates) is in it ſelf an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Grape, and by art doubtleſs may be cultivated to an excellent Wine, if not ſo ſweet, yet little inferiour to the <hi>Frontiniack,</hi> as it is not much unlike in taſte, ruddineſs ſet aſide, which in ſuch things, as well as Mankind, differs the caſe much. There is a white kind of Muskadel, and a little black Grape, like the cluſter of Grapes in <hi>England,</hi> not yet ſo ripe as the other, but they tell me when ripe, ſweeter, and that they only want skilful <hi>Vinerons</hi> to make good uſe of them; <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to venture on it with my</hi> French-<hi>Man this Seaſon, who ſhews ſome knowledge in thoſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are alſo Peaches, very good, and in great quantities, not an <hi>Indian</hi> Plantation without them;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199140:58"/> but whether naturally here at firſt, I know not, however one may have them by Buſhels for little; they make a pleaſant Drink, and I think not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to any Peach you have in <hi>England,</hi> except the true <hi>Newington.</hi> 'Tis diſputable with me, whether it be beſt to fall to Fining the Fruits of the Country, eſpecially the Grapes, by the care and skill of Art, or ſend for Forreign Stems and Sets already good and approved; it ſeems moſt reaſonable to believe, that not only a thing grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt, where it naturally grows; but will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be equall'd by another's Species of the ſame kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to reſolve this doubt, I intend (if God give me life) to try both, and hope the Conſequences will be as good Wine as any <hi>European</hi> Countries of the ſame Latitude do yield.</p>
                  <p>The artificial Product<note place="margin">Its Product.</note> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Peaſe, Beans, Squaſhes, Pumkins, Water-Melons, Musk-Melons, and all Herbs and Roots that our Gardens in <hi>England</hi> uſually bring forth.</p>
                  <p>Of Living Creatures,<note place="margin">Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> as Fiſh, Fowl, and the Beaſt of the Woods, here are divers ſorts, ſome for Food and Profit, and ſome for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit only; for food as well as profit, the Elk, as big as a ſmall Ox, Deer bigger than ours, Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Racoon, Rabbits, Squirrils, and ſome eat young Bear, and commend it. Of Fowls of the Land, there is the Turkey, (forty or fifty pound weight) which is very great; Pheaſants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons, and Patridges in abundance: Of the Water, the Swan, Gooſe, white and gray, Ducks, Teal, alſo the Snipe and Curloe, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199140:58"/> that in great numbers; but the Duck and Teal excel, nor ſo good have I ever eat in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Of Fiſh, there is the Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Catſhead, Eel, Smelt, Pearch, Roch; and in Inland Rivers, Trout, ſome ſay Salmon, above the Falls. Of Shell-fiſh, we have Oyſters, Crabs, Cockles, Concks, Muſeta's; ſome Oyſters ſix Inches long,; and one ſort of Cockles, as big as the ſtewing Oyſter; they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for profit only, by Skin or Furr, and that are natural to thoſe Parts, are the Wild-Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fiſher, Minx, Musk-Rat: And of the Water, the Whale for Oyl, of which we have good ſtore; and two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Whalers, whoſe Boats are built, will ſoon begin their work, which hath the appearance of a conſiderable improvement to nothing of our reaſonable hopes, of good Cod in the Bay. We have no want of Horſes, and ſome are very good, &amp; ſhapely enough; two Ships have been fraighted to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with Horſes and Pipe-ſtaves, ſince my coming in; here is alſo plenty of Cow-Cattel, and ſome Sheep; the People Plow moſtly with Oxen.</p>
                  <p>There are divers Plants,<note place="margin">Plants.</note> that not only the <hi>Indians</hi> tell us, but we have had occaſion to prove, by Swellings, Burns, Cuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they are of great virtue, ſuddenly curing the Patient; and for ſmell, I have obſerved ſeveral, eſpecially one, the wild Mirtle; the other I know not what to call, but are moſt fragrant; the Woods are adorned with love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers, for colour, greatneſs, figure and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety; I have ſeen the Gardens of <hi>London</hi> beſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that ſort of beauty, but think they may be improved by our Woods; I have ſent a few to a Perſon of Quality this year for a Tryal. Thus
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199140:59"/> much of the <hi>Country;</hi> next of the <hi>Natives</hi> or <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Natives</hi> I ſhall conſider in their <hi>Perſons, Language, Manners, Religion and Government,</hi> with my ſenſe of their <hi>Original.</hi> For their <hi>Perſons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Perſons.</note> they are generally tall, ſtreight, well built, and of ſingular proportion; they tread ſtrong and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and moſtly walk with a lofty Chin; of Complexion black, but by deſign, as the Gypſies in <hi>England;</hi> they greaſe themſelves with Bear's Fat clarifi'd, and uſing no defence againſt Sun or Weather, there Skins muſt needs be ſwarthy; their Eye is little and black, not unlike a ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd Jew; the thick Lip and flat Noſe, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the <hi>Eaſt-Indians</hi> and <hi>Blacks,</hi> are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them; for I have ſeen as comely <hi>European</hi>-like Faces among them, of both, as on your ſide the Sea; and truly an <hi>Italian</hi> Complexion hath not much more of the White, and the Noſes of ſeveral of them have as much of the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Language</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Cuſtoms <hi>and</hi> Manners.</note> there is much to be ſaid. I will begin with <hi>Children:</hi> So ſoon as they are born, they waſh them in Water; and while very young, and in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuſe, they plunge them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them: Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a ſtrait thin Board, a little more than the length &amp; breadth of the Child, and ſwaddle it faſt upon the Board, to make it ſtreight; wherefore all <hi>Indians</hi> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs. The Children will go very young, at nine Months com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; they wear only a ſmall Clout round their Waiſt till they are big; if Boys, they go a Fiſhing till ripe for the Woods, which is about fifteen; then they Hunt, and having given ſome proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of Skins, they may Marry, elſe it is ſhame to think of a Wife. The Girls ſtay with their Mothers, and help to Hoe the Ground, Plant Corn, and carry Burthens; and they do well to uſe them to that Young, which they muſt do when they are Old; for the Wives are the true Servants of their Husbands; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Men are very affectionate to them. When the young Women are fit for Marriage, they wear ſomething upon their Heads for an Advertiſement,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199140:60"/> but ſo as their Faces are hardly to be ſeen, but when they pleaſe: The Age they Marry at, if Women, is about thirteen and fourteen; if Men, ſeventeen and eighteen; they are rarely elder: their Houſes are Mats, or Barks of Trees, ſet on Poles, in the faſhion of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barn, but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a man; they lie on Reeds or Graſs. In travel they lodge in the Woods about a great fire, with the Mantle-Duffils they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs ſtuck round them. Their Diet is <hi>Maiz</hi> or <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> divers ways prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; ſometimes roaſted in the Aſhes, ſometimes beaten and boiled with Water, which they call <hi>Homine;</hi> they alſo make Cakes, not unpleaſant to eat; they have likewiſe ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Beans</hi> and <hi>Peaſe,</hi> that are good nouriſhment; and the Woods and Rivers are their Larder.</p>
                  <p>If an <hi>European</hi> comes to ſee them,<note place="margin">Their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or calls for Lodging at their Houſe or <hi>Wigwam,</hi> they give him the beſt place and firſt cut.

They are great concealers of their own reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; brought to it, I believe, by the revenge that hath been practiſed among them; in either of theſe they are not exceeded by the <hi>Italians.</hi> A Tragical Inſtance fell out ſince I came into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:199140:60"/> Country; A King's Daughter, thinking herſelf ſlighted by her Husband, in ſuffering another Women to lie down between them, roſe up, went out, pluckt a Root out of the ground, and eat it, upon which ſhe immediately died; and for which, laſt Week, he made an Offering to her Kindred, for Atonement, Liberty, and Marriage, as two others did to the Kindred of their Wives, that died a natural death: for till Widowers have done ſo, they muſt not Marry again. Some of the young Women are ſaid to take undue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty before Marriage for a Portion; but when Married, chaſte: when with Child, they know their Husbands no more, till delivered; and, during their Month, they touch no Meat they eat, but with a ſtick, leſt they ſhould defile it; nor do their Husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</p>
                  <p>But in Liberality<note place="margin">Their Liberality</note> they excel, nothing is too good for their Friend; give them a fine Gun, Coat, or other thing, it may paſs twenty hands, before it ſticks; light of heart, ſtrong affections, but ſoon ſpent; the moſt merry Creatures that live, Feaſt and Dance perpetually; they never have much, nor want much: Wealth circulateth like the Blood, all parts partake; and though none ſhall want what another hath, yet exact obſervers of Property. Some Kings have ſold, others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with ſeveral Parcels of Land; the Pay or Preſent I made them, were not hoarded by the particular owners, but the neighbouring Kings and their Clans being preſent when the Goods were brought out, the parties chiefly concerned conſulted, what and to whom they ſhould give them; to every King then, by the hands of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199140:61"/> for that work appointed, is a portion ſent, ſo ſorted and folded, and with that gravity, that it is admirable; then that King ſubdivideth it in like manner among the dependants, they hardly leaving themſelves an equal ſhare with one of their Subjects: and be it on ſuch occaſions as Feſtivals, or at their common Meals, the Kings diſtribute, and to themſelves laſt; they care for little, and the reaſon is, a little contents them: In this they are ſufficiently revenged on us; if they are ignorant of our pleaſures, they are alſo free from our pains. They are not diſquieted with Bills of Lading and Exchange, nor perplexed with Chancery-Suits and Exchequer-Reckonings; we ſweat and toil to live, their pleaſure feeds them, I mean their Hunting, Fiſhing and Fowling, and this Table is ſpread every where; they eat twice a day, Morning and Evening; their Seats and Tables are the Ground. Since the <hi>Europeans</hi> came into thoſe parts, they are grown great lovers of ſtrong Liquors, <hi>Rum</hi> eſpecially; and for it they exchange the richeſt of their Skins and Furs: If they are healed with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, they are reſtleſs till they have enough to ſleep; and this is their cry, <hi>Some more, and I will go to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In ſickneſs, impatient to be cured; for it, give any thing, eſpecially for their Children, to whom they are extreamly natural; they drink at thoſe times a <hi>Teran</hi> or Decoſtion of ſome Roots, in Spring-water; and if they eat any fleſh, it muſt be of the Female of any Creature: if they die, they bury them with their Apparel, be they Men or Women, and the neareſt of Kin ſlings in ſomething precious with them, as a token of their love: their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is blacking of their faces, which they continue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:199140:61"/> for a Year: they are choice of the Graves of their dead; for, leſt they ſhould be loſt by time, and fall to common uſe, they pick off the Graſs that grows upon them, and heap up the fallen Earth with great care and exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe poor people are under a dark Night in things relating to Religion,<note place="margin">Their Religion.</note> to be ſure the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; yet they believe a God and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity without the helps of <hi>Metaphyſicks;</hi> for they ſay there is a great King that made them, who dwells in a glorious Country to the Southward of them, and that the Souls of the good ſhall go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where they ſhall live again. Their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſts of two parts, Sacrifice and Cantico: Their Sacrifice is their firſt Fruits, the firſt and fatteſt Buck they kill, goes to the Fire, where he is all burnt with a mournful Ditty of him that performs the Ceremony, but with ſuch marvellous fervency and labour of Body, that he will even ſweat to a Foam; the other part of their Cantico, is performed by round Dances, ſometimes Words, ſometimes Songs, then Shouts; two being in the middle that begin, and by ſinging and drumming on a Board, direct the Chorus; their Poſtures in the Dance are very antick and differing, but all keep meaſure. This is done with equal earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and labour, but great appearance of Joy. In the Fall, when the Corn comes in, they begin to feaſt one another; there have been two great Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivals already, to which all come that will: I was at one my ſelf; their entertainment was a great Seat by a Spring, under ſome ſhady Trees, and twenty Bucks, with hot Cakes of new Corn, both Wheat and Beans, which they make up in a ſquare form, in the Leaves of the Stem, and bake them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:199140:62"/> in the Aſhes; and after that, they fell to dance; but they that go, muſt carry a ſmall Preſent of their Money, it may be ſix pence, which is made in the Bone of a Fiſh; the black is with them as Gold, the white Silver; they call it all <hi>Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Government<note place="margin">Government.</note> is by Kings which they call <hi>Sachema,</hi> and thoſe by ſucceſſion, but always of the Mothers-ſide; for inſtance, the Children of him that is now King, will not ſucceed, but his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Mother, or the Children of his Siſter, whoſe Sons (and after them the Children of her Daughters) will reign; for no Woman inherits: the Reaſon they render for this way of Deſcent, is, that their Iſſue may not be ſpurious. Every King hath his Council, and that conſiſts of all the old and wiſe men of his Nation, which perhaps is two hundred People: Nothing of moment is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, be it War, Peace, ſelling of Land, Traffick, without adviſing with them; and which is more, with the young men too. 'Tis admirable to conſider how powerful the Kings are, and how they move by the Breath of the People. I have had occaſion to be in Council with them upon Treaties of Land, and to adjuſt the Terms of Trade: Their Order is thus; The King ſits in the middle of a half-Moon, and hath his Council, the old and wiſe on each hand; behind them, or at a little diſtance, ſit the younger Fry in the ſame Figure; having conſulted and reſolved their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, the King ordered one of them to ſpeak to me, and he in the Name of his King ſaluted me; then took me by the hand, and told me, That he was ordered by his King to ſpeak to me; and that now it was not he, but the King that ſpoke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199140:62"/> what he ſhould ſay, was the King's Mind. He firſt prayed me to excuſe them that they had not complied with me the laſt time, he feared there might be ſome fault in the Interpreter, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Indian</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh;</hi> beſides it was the <hi>Indian</hi> cuſtom to deliberate, and take up much time in Council before they reſolve; and that if the young People and Owners of the Land had been as ready as he, I had not met with ſo much delay. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus introduced this Matter, he fell to the Bounds of the Land they had agreed to diſpoſe of, and the Price (which now is little and dear, that which would have bought twenty Miles, not buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now two.) During the time that this Perſon ſpoke, not a man of them was obſerved to whiſper or ſmile; the Old grave, the Young reverent in their deportment: They do ſpeak little, but fervently and with elegancy; I have never ſeen more natural ſagacity, conſidering them without the help of Tradition; and he will deſerve the Name of wiſe, that out-wits them in any Treaty about a thing they underſtand.</p>
                  <p>When the Purchaſe was agreed, great Promiſes paſſed between us of Kindneſs and good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and that the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> muſt live in Love as long as the Sun gave Light; which done, another made a Speech to the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Name of all the <hi>Sachamakers</hi> or Kings, firſt to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them to love <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and particularly to live in peace with me, and the People under my Government: That many Governors had been in the River, but that no Governor had come himſelf to live and ſtay here before; and having now ſuch a one that had treated them well, they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do him or his any wrong. At every Sentence
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:199140:63"/> of which, they ſhouted, and ſaid, <hi>Amen,</hi> in their way.</p>
                  <p>The Juſtice<note place="margin">Their Juſtice.</note> they have is pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary; in caſe of any wrong or evil fact, be it Murder itſelf, they atone by Feaſts and Preſents of their <hi>Wampum,</hi> which is proportioned to the quality of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or Perſon injur'd, of the Sex they are of: For in caſe they kill a Woman, they pay double; and the reaſon they render, is, That ſhe breedeth Children, which men cannot do. 'Tis rare that they fall out, if ſober; and if drunk, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it; ſaying, it was the Drink, and not the Man, that abuſed them. We have agreed, that in all differences between us, ſix of each ſide ſhall end the Matter. Don't abuſe them, but let them have Juſtice, and you win them: The worſt is, they are the worſe for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have propagated their Vices, and yielded them Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ill, and not for good things. But as low an Ebb as they are at, and in as glorious as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition looks, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have not out-liv'd their ſight with all their Pretenſions to an higher mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation. What Good then might not a good People graft, where there is ſo diſtinct a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge left between good and evil? I beſeech God to encline the hearts of all that come into theſe parts, to out-live the Knowledge of the Natives, by a fixt obedience to their greater Knowledge of the Will of God; for it were miſerable indeed for us to fall under the juſt cenſure of the poor <hi>Indian</hi> Conſcience, while we make profeſſion of things ſo far tranſcending.</p>
                  <p>For their Original,<note place="margin">Their Original.</note> I am ready to believe them of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Race; I mean of the ſtock of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:199140:63"/> Ten Tribes; and that for the following Reaſons: Firſt, They were to go to a Land not planted or known; which to be ſure <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> were, if not <hi>Europe;</hi> and he that intended that extraordinary Judgment upon them, might make the Paſſage not uneaſie to them, as it is not unpoſſible in itſelf, from the Eaſtermoſt; parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Weſtermoſt parts of <hi>America.</hi> In the next place, I find them of like countenance, and their Children of ſo lively reſemblance, that a man would think himſelf in <hi>Dukes-Place</hi> or <hi>Berry-Street</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> when he ſeeth them. But this is not all; they agree in Rites, they reckon by Moons, they offer their firſt Fruits, they have a kind of Feaſt of Tabernacles, they are ſaid to lay their Altar upon twelve Stones, their mourning a year, Cuſtoms of Women, with many things that do not now occur.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:199140:64"/> but they are a plain, ſtrong, induſtrious People, yet have made no great progreſs in Culture, or propagation of Fruit-trees; as if they deſired rather to have enough, than Plenty or Traffick. But I preſume the <hi>Indians</hi> made them more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by furniſhing them with the means of Profit, to wit, Skins and Furs for <hi>Rum,</hi> and ſuch ſtrong Liquors. They kindly received me as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were few, before the People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with me, came among them. I muſt needs commend their reſpect to Authority, and kind behaviour to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> they do not degenerate from the old Friendſhip between both Kingdoms. As they are People proper and ſtrong of Body, ſo they have fine Children, and almoſt every houſe full; rare to find one of them without three of four Boys, and as many Girls; ſome ſix, ſeven and eight Sons: And I muſt do them that right, I ſee few young men more ſober and laborious. The <hi>Dutch</hi> have a Meeting-place for Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, at <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> three, one at <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> one at <hi>Tenecum,</hi> and one at <hi>Wicoco,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a Mile of this Town.</p>

But this I will ſay for the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, That of all the many Places I have ſeen in the world, I remember not one better ſeated; ſo that it ſeems to me, to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointned for a Town, whether we regard the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or the conveniency of the <hi>Coves, Docks, Springs,</hi> the loftineſs and ſoundneſs of the Land and the Ayr, held by the People of thoſe Parts, to be very good. It is advanced within leſs than a Year to about fourſcore Houſes and Cottages, ſuch as they are; where Merchants and Handicraftſmen are following their Vocations as faſt as they can, while the Countrey-men are cloſe in their Farms: Some of them got a little Winter-Corn in the Ground laſt Seaſon, and the generality have had

The City is ſo ordered now, by the Governour's Care and Prudence, that it hath a Front to each River, one half at <hi>Delaware,</hi> the other at <hi>Skulkil;</hi> and though all this cannot make way for ſmall Purchaſers to be in the Fronts, Yet they are placed in the next Streets, contiguous to each Front; <hi>viz.</hi> all Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of one thouſand Acres and upwards, have the Fronts, (and the High-Street) and to every five thouſand Acres purchaſe in the Front, about an Acre, and the ſmaller Purchaſers about half an Acre in the backward Street; by which means the leaſt hath room enough for a Houſe, Garden, and a ſmall Orchard, to the great content and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all here concerned.</p>
                  <p>The City conſiſts of a large Front-Street to each River, and a High-Street, (near the middle) front (or River) to front, of one hundred foot broad, and a broad Street in the middle of the City, from ſide to ſide, ſquare of ten Acres; at each Angle are to be Houſes for Publick Affairs, as a Meeting-Houſe Aſſembly or State-Houſe, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Houſe, School-Houſe, and ſeveral other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for other concerns.

                  <p n="1">1. We have had about <hi>Ninety Sail</hi> of Ships, with Paſſengers,<note place="margin">Its Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> ſince the beginning of the Year 1682, and not one Veſſel, deſigned to this Province, through God's mercy, hitherto miſcarried.</p>
                  <p>The Eſtimate of the People may be thus made; Eighty to each Ship; which comes to Seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred Perſons: at leaſt a Thouſand there before, with ſuch as from other places in our neighbourhood are ſince come to reſide among us: and, I preſume, the Births at leaſt equal to the Burials; for having made our firſt Settlement high in the Freſhes of the River, we do not find our ſelves ſubject to thoſe ſeaſonings that affect ſome other Countries upon the ſame Coaſt.</p>
                  <p>The People are a Collection of divers Nations in <hi>Europe:</hi>

                  <head>Of Country-Settlement.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. We do ſettle in the way of Townſhips or Villages,<note place="margin">Their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> each of which contains 5000 Acres in ſquare, and at leaſt ten Famlies, the regulation of the Country, being a Family to each 500 Acres; ſome Townſhips have more, where the intereſt of the People is leſs than that quantity, which often falls out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many that had right to more Land, were at firſt covetous to have their whole quantity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to this way of ſettlement, though by ſuch Wilderneſs-Vacancies they had ruined the Country, and their own Intereſt, of courſe. I had in my View, <hi>Society, Aſſiſtance, eaſie Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, Inſtruction of Youth, Government of Peoples Manners, Conveniency of Religious aſſembling, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Mechanicks, diſtinct and beaten Roads,</hi> and it was anſwered in all theſe reſpects, I think, to an univerſal content.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our Townſhips lie ſquare, generally the Village in the centre; The Houſes either oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, or elſe oppoſite to the middle, betwixt two Houſes over the way, for nearer neighbourhood. We have another method, that through the Village be in the centre, yet after a different manner: five hundred Acres are alotted for the Village, which, among ten Families, comes to fifty Acres each: this lies ſquare, and on the outſide of the Square ſtands the Houſes, and their fifty Acres run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning back, whoſe ends meeting, make the centre of the 500 Acres as they are to the whole. Before the Doors of whole Houſes, lies the Highway, and croſs it every man's 450 Acres of Land, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:199140:69"/> makes up his Complement of 500; ſo that the conveniency of Neighbourhood is made agreeable with that of the Land.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ſaid nothing in my laſt, of any number of Townſhips, but there were at leaſt Fifty ſettled, before my leaving thoſe Parts, which was in the Month called <hi>August</hi> 1684.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I viſited many of them, and found them much advanced in their Improvements; Houſes over their heads, and Garden-plots, Coverts for their Cattle, an encreaſe of Stock, and ſeveral Enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in Corn eſpecially, the firſt Commerce: And I may ſay of ſome poor men, even to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of an Eſtate, the difference of labouring for themſelves and for others; of an Inheritance, and a Rack-Leaſe being never better underſtood.</p>

                  <head>The Product of the Earth.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Earth,</hi> by Gods Bleſſing, has more than anſwered our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">The Earths Product.</note> the pooreſt places in our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, producing large Crops of Garden ſtuff, and Grain; and though our Ground has not generally the Symptoms of the fat Necks that lie upon Salt Waters in Provinces Southern of us, our Grain is thought to excel, and our Crops to be as large. We have had the mark of the good Ground amongſt us, from thirty to ſixty-fold of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Corn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Land requires leſs Seed; three Pecks of Wheat ſows an Acre; a Buſhel at moſt, and ſome have had the encreaſe I have mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Upon Trial, we find that the Corn and Roots that grow in <hi>England,</hi> thrive very well there; as, <hi>Wheat, Barley, Rye, Oats, Buck-Wheat, Peaſe,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:199140:69"/> Beans, Cabbages, Turneps, Carrots, Parſneps, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, Aſparagus, Onions, Charlots, Garlick,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Potatoes;</hi> we have alſo the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and very good <hi>Rice,</hi> which do not grow here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Low-Lands are excellent for <hi>Rape,</hi> and <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax.</hi> A Trial hath been made, and of the two laſt there is a conſiderable quantity dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed yearly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Weeds of our Woods feed our Cattel, to the Market as well as Dairy: I have ſeen fat Bullocks brought thence to Market before <hi>Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> Our Swamps or Maarſhes yield us courſe Hay for the Winter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Engliſh</hi> Graſs-Seed takes well; which will give us fatting Hay in time. Of this I made an Experiment in my own Court-Yard, upon Sand that was digg'd out of my Cellar, with Seed that had lain in a Cask, open to the Weather two Winters and a Summer; I caus'd it to be ſown in the beginning of the Month called <hi>April,</hi> and a fortnight before <hi>Midſummer</hi> it was fit to mow; it grew very thick; but I ordered it to be fed, being in the nature of a Graſs-Plot, on purpoſe to ſee if the Roots lay firm; and though it had been meer Sand caſt out of the Cellar, but a year before, the Seed took ſuch Root, and held the Earth ſo faſt, and faſtened it ſelf ſo well in the Earth, that it held and fed like old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground. I mention this, to confute the Objections that lie againſt thoſe Parts; as if that, Firſt, <hi>Engliſh</hi> Graſs would not grow; next, not enough to mow; and laſtly, not firm enough to feed, from the levity of the Mould.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All ſorts of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fruits that have been tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, take mighty well for the time; the <hi>Peach</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; on Standers; and in great quantities:
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199140:70"/> They Sun-dry them, and lay them up in Lofts, as we do Roots here, and ſtew them with Meat in Winter-time. <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> and <hi>Water-Melons</hi> are raiſed here, with as little care as <hi>Pumpkins</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the <hi>Vine</hi> eſpecially prevails, which grows every where; and upon Experience of ſome <hi>French People</hi> from <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Rhee.</hi>

Of both theſe, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants increaſe their Winter-Store: Theſe are caught by Nets, Hooks and Spears.</p>

'Tis ſo called from a noiſe it makes in its Belly when it is taken, reſembling a Drum. There are three ſorts of them, the Black, Red, and Gold-colour; the Black is fat in the Spring, the Red in the Fall, and the Gold-colour, believed to be the Black grown old, becauſe it is obſerved that young ones of that colour have not been taken. They generally take them by Hook and line, as they do <hi>Cod,</hi> and they ſave like it, where People are skilful.

                  <p n="1">1. It has been often ſaid, we are ſtarved for want of Food;<note place="margin">Proviſion.</note> ſome were apt to ſugeſt their Fears, others to inſinuate their Prejudice, and when this was contracted, and they aſſured we had plenty, both of Bread, Fiſh and Fleſh, then 'twas objected, we were forced to fetch it from other places at great Charges: But neither is all this true, though all the World will, think we muſt either bring Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with us, or get it of the Neighbourhood till we had gotten houſes over our heads, and a little Land in tillage. We fetched none, nor were we wholly kept by Neighbours; the old Inhabitants ſupplied us with moſt of the Corn we wanted, and a good ſhare of Pork and Beef: 'Tis true, <hi>New-York, New-England,</hi> and <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> did with their Proviſions fetch our Goods and Money, but at ſuch Rates, that ſome ſold for almoſt what they gave, and others carried their Proviſions back, expecting a better Market nearer; which ſhewed no ſcarcity, and that we were not totally deſtitute in our own River. But if my Advice be of any value, I would have them buy ſtill, and not weaken their Herds, by killing up their young Stock too ſoon.</p>
                  <p>But the right meaſure of Information muſt be the proportion of value of Proviſion there, to what they are in more planted and mature Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. <hi>Beef</hi> is commonly ſold at the rate of two pence <hi>per</hi> pound; and <hi>Pork</hi> for two pence halfpeny, <hi>Veal</hi> and <hi>Mutton</hi> at three pence, or three pence halfpeny of that Countrey Money; an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shilling goes for Sixteen pence. Grain ſells by the Buſhel; <hi>Wheat</hi> at four ſhillings, <hi>Rye,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199140:71"/> good, at three ſhillings; <hi>Barley,</hi> two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings ſix pence, <hi>Indian Corn</hi> two ſhillings ſix pence, <hi>Oats,</hi> two ſhillings, in that Money ſtill, which in a new Countrey, where Grain is ſo much wanted for Seed, as well as Food, cannot be called dear; and eſpecially if we conſider the conſumption of the many new Comers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is ſo great an encreaſe of Grain, by the diligent application of People to Husbandry, that within three years, ſome Plantations have got twenty Acres in Corn, ſome forty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are very careful to increaſe their Stock, and get into Dairies as faſt as they can. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready make good Butter and Cheeſe. A good Cow and a Calf by her ſide, may be worth three pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> in Goods at firſt coſt.

                        <p>HAving an opportunity by a Ship from this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (out of which ſeveral have gone this year) I thought fit to give a ſhort account of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as to Settlement here, and the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in Town and Countrey: As to the Countrey, the Improvements are large, and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements very much thronged, by way of Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Villages, great inclination to planting Orchards, which are eaſily raiſed, and ſome brought to perfection, much Hay-ſeed ſown, and much planting of Corn this year, and great product ſaid to be, both of <hi>Wheat, Rye</hi> and <hi>Rice; Barly</hi> and <hi>Oats</hi> prove very well; beſides <hi>Indian Corn</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> of ſeveral ſorts; alſo <hi>Kidney-Beans,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Peaſe</hi> of ſeveral kinds, I have had in my own Ground, with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Roots, <hi>Turnips, Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, Carrots, Onions, Leeks, Radiſhes</hi> and <hi>Cabbages,</hi> with abundance of Herbs and Flowers: I know but of few Seeds that have miſs'd, except <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Seed,</hi> which being <hi>Engliſh,</hi> might be old. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I have ſuch plenty of <hi>Pumkins, Musk-Melons, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Melons, Squaſhes, Coſhaws, Bucks-hens, Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> and <hi>Simnels</hi> of divers ſorts, admired at by new comers, that the Earth ſhould ſo plentifully caſt forth, eſpecially the firſt years breaking up, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199140:72"/> on that which is counted the worſt ſort of Sandy Land. I am ſatisfied, and many more, that the Earth is very fertil, and the Lord hath done his part, if man uſe but a moderate diligence: <hi>Grapes, Mulberries,</hi> and many wild Fruits, and natural <hi>Plums</hi> in abundance this year have I ſeen and eat of. A brave Orchard and Nurſery have I planted, and they thrive mightily, and bear Fruit the firſt year; I endeavour to get choice of Fruits and Seeds from many parts; alſo <hi>Hay-Seed,</hi> and have ſowed a Field this Spring for Trial. Firſt, I burned the Leaves, then had it grubb'd, not the Fields, but the ſmall Roots up, then ſow'd great and ſmall <hi>Clovers,</hi> with a little old Graſs-Seed, and had it only raked over, not plowed nor harrowed, and it grows exceedingly: Alſo, for Experience, I ſowed ſome Patches of the ſame ſort in my Garden, and dunged ſome, and that grows worſt; I have planted the <hi>Iriſh Potatoes,</hi> and hope to have a brave encreaſe to tranſplant next year. Captain <hi>Rapel</hi> (the <hi>Frenchman</hi>) ſaith, he made good Wine of the Grapes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try laſt year, and tranſplanted ſome, but intends to make more this year; alſo a <hi>Frenchman</hi> in this Town intends the ſame; for Grapes are very plentiful.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the Town of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it goes on in Planting and Building to admiration, both in the Front and backward, and there are about 600 Houſes in three years time; and ſince I built my Brick-Houſe, the Foundation of which was laid at my going, which I deſign after a good manner, to encourage others, and that from building with Wood; it being the firſt, many take example; and ſome that built wooden Houſes, are ſorry for it; Brick Building is ſaid to be as cheap: Bricks
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:199140:73"/> are exceeding good, and better than when I built, more makers fallen in, and Bricks cheaper; they were before at 16 <hi>s. Engliſh, per</hi> Thouſand, and now many brave Brick houſes are going up with good Cellars. <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> is building him a brave Brick Houſe near <hi>William Frampton</hi>'s, on the Front; for <hi>William Frampton</hi> hath ſince built a good Brick Houſe, by his Brew-houſe and Bake-houſe, and lett the other for an Ordinary. <hi>John Wheeler</hi> from <hi>New-England,</hi> is building a good Brick Houſe by the <hi>Blew Anchor,</hi> and the two Brick-makers a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Brick Houſe and Cellars; beſides ſeveral other going on. <hi>Samuel Carpenter</hi> has built another Houſe by his. I am building another Brick Houſe by mine, which is three large Stories high, beſides a good large Brick Cellar under it of two Bricks and a half thickneſs in the Wall, and the next Story half under ground; the Cellar has an arched Door for a Vault to go (under the Street) to the River, and ſo to bring in Goods, or deliver out. <hi>Humphrey Murry,</hi> from <hi>New-York,</hi> has built a large Timber-Houſe with Brick Chimneys. <hi>John Test</hi> has almoſt finiſhed a good Brick Houſe, and a Bake-houſe of Timber; and <hi>N. Allen</hi> a good Houſe next to <hi>Thomas Wynn</hi>'s Front-Lot. <hi>John Day</hi> a good Houſe after the <hi>London</hi> faſhion, moſt Brick with a large Frame of Wood in the Front, for Shop-windows; all theſe have Balconies. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> and <hi>Daniel P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ge</hi> are Partners, and ſet to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Brick this year, and they are very good: Alſo <hi>Paſtours,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Friend; Agent for the Company at <hi>Frankford,</hi> with his <hi>Dutch</hi> People, are preparing to make Bricks next year. <hi>Samuel Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> is our Lime-burner on his Wharf. Brave Lime ſtone is found here, as the Workmen ſay, being proved. We build moſt Houſes with Balco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199140:73"/> Lots are much deſired in the Town; great buying one of anothe. We are now laying the Foundation of a large plain Brick Houſe for a Meeting-Houſe, in the Center (ſixty foot long, and about forty foot broad) and hope to have it ſoon up, there being many hearts and hands at work that will do it: A large Meeting-houſe, fifty foot long, and thirty eight broad alſo going on the front of the River, for an Evening-Meeting, the Work going on apace; many Towns-people ſetling their Liberty-Lands. I hope the Society will rub off the Reproaches ſome have caſt upon them. We now begin to gather in ſomething of our many great Debts.</p>
                        <p>I do underſtand three Companies for Whale-catching, are deſigned to fiſh in the Rivers-mouth this Seaſon, and find through the great plenty of Fiſh, they may begin early. A Fiſherman this year found a way to catch <hi>Whitings</hi> in this River; and it is expected, many ſorts of Fiſh more than has been yet caught, may be taken by the skilful. Fiſh are in ſuch plenty, that many ſorts on Tryal, have been taken with Nets in the Winter-time. The <hi>Swedes</hi> laughing at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for going to try, have ſince tried themſelves. The River is ſo big, and full of ſeveral ſorts of brave Fiſh, that its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, except frozen over, we may catch any time in the Winter. It is great pity, but two or three experienced Fiſhermen were here to ply this River, to ſalt, and ſerve, freſh Fiſh to the Town. A good way to pickle <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is wanting; ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance being in the River, even before the Town: many are catcht, boyled, and eaten. Laſt Winter great plenty of Deer were brought in by the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the Country. We are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very well and healthy here, but abundance dead in <hi>Maryland</hi> this Summer.</p>

                        <p>The Manufacture of Linnen by the <hi>Germans</hi> goes on finely, and they make fine Linnen. <hi>Samuel Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter</hi> having been lately there, declares, They had gathered one Crop of Flax, and had ſown the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſaw it come up well, and, they ſay, might have had forwarder and better, had they had old Seed, and not ſtayed ſo long for the growth of the new Seed to ſow again.

                        <p>I thought fit to ſignifie thus much, knowing thou wouldſt be glad to hear of the People and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces welfare: The Lord preſerve us all, and make way for thy return, which is much deſired, not only by our friends, but all ſorts, I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thy truly Loving Friend,</p>

                  <head>Advice to Adventurers how to imploy their Eſtates with fair profit.</head>
                  <p>It is ſit now that I give ſome Advertiſement to Adventurers,<note place="margin">Advice to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers.</note> which way they may lay out their money to beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſo as it may yield them fair returns, and with content to all concerned, which is the laſt part of my preſent task; and I muſt needs ſay ſo much wanting, that it has perhaps given ſome occaſion to ignorance and prejudice to run without mercy, meaſure or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, againſt <hi>America,</hi> of which, <hi>Penſylvania</hi> to be ſure has had its ſhare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is agreed on all hands, that the poor are the hands and feet of the rich. It is their labour that improves Countries, and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the Publick. Now as there are abundance of theſe People in many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> extreamly deſirous of going to <hi>America,</hi> ſo the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return thereof to the Disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, will prove what I ſay to be true.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are two ſorts, ſuch as are able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves and Families, but have nothing to begin with there, and thoſe that want ſo much as to tranſport themſelves and Families thither.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The firſt of theſe may be entertained in this manner. Say I have five thouſand Acres, I will ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ten Families upon them in way of Village, and build each an Houſe, an out-Houſe for Cattel, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh every Family with ſtock; as four Cows, two Sows, a couple of Mares, and a yoke of Oxen, with a Town-horſe, Bull and Boar. I find them with Tools, and give each their firſt Ground-ſeed;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199140:75"/> they ſhall continue ſeven years, or more, at half increaſe, being bound to leave the Houſes in repair, and a Garden and Orchard, I paying for the Trees, and at leaſt twenty Acres of Land within Fence, and improved to Corn and Graſs. The charge will come to about ſixty pounds <hi>Engliſh</hi> each Family; at the ſeven years end, the improvement will be worth, as things go now, one hundred and twenty pounds, beſides the value of the encreaſe of the Stock, which may be near as much more, allowing for caſualties, eſpecially if the People are honeſt and careful, or a man be upon the Spot himſelf, or have an Overſeer ſometimes to inſpect them. The charge in the whole is eight hundred thirty and two Pounds. I think I have been modeſt in my Computation. Theſe Farms afterwards are ſit for Leaſes at full Rent, or how elſe the owner ſhall pleaſe to diſpoſe of them; alſo the People will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to ſettle themſelves with Stock upon their own Land.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The other ſort of poor People may be very beneficially tranſported upon theſe terms. Say I have five thouſand Acres, I ſhould ſettle as before, I will give to each Family one hundred Acres, which in the whole makes one thouſand, and to each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily thirty Pounds <hi>Engliſh,</hi> half in hand and half there, which in the whole comes to three hundred Pounds, after four days are expired, in which time they may be eaſie, and in a good condition; they ſhall each of them pay 5 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm-rent, which in the whole comes to fifty Pounds a year. Thus a Man that buys five thouſand Acres may ſecure and ſettle his four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand by the gift of one, and in a way that hazard and intereſt allowed for, amounts to at leaſt ten
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199140:75"/> 
                     <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon Land ſecurity, beſides the value it puts upon the reſt of the five thouſand Acres. I propoſe that there be at the leaſt two working hands beſides the Wife, whether Son or Servant, and that they oblige what they carry; and for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecurity, bind themſelves as Servants for ſome time, that they will ſettle the ſaid Land according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And when they are once ſeated their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſecurity enough for the Rent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is yet another expedient, and that is, to give ten Families one thouſand Acres for ever, at a ſmall acknowledgment, and ſettle them in way of Village, as afore; by their ſeating thus, the Land taken up is ſecured from others, becauſe the method of the Country is anſwered, and the value ſuch a ſettlement gives to the reſt reſerved, is not inconſiderable, I mean the four thouſand Acres, eſpecially that which is contiguous, for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when grown up, and Handicrafts, will ſoon covet to fix next them, and ſuch and ſuch after ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements to begin at an improved rent in Fee, or for long Leaſes, or ſmall acknowledgments, and good improvements muſt advance the whole conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably. I conceive any of theſe methods to iſſue in a ſufficient advantage to Adventurers, and they all give good encouragement to feeble and poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which is moſt adviſable for People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thither, to carry with them, is, in ſhort, all things relating to Apparel, Building, Houſhold-ſtuff, Husbandry, Fowling and Fiſhing, ſome Spice, Spirits, and double Beer, at firſt, were not amiſs. But I adviſe all to proportion their Eſtates thus, one third in Money, and two thirds in Goods. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Pieces of Eight there will be almoſt a third gotten, for they go at ſix ſhillings; and by Goods
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:199140:76"/> well bought, at leaſt fifty Pounds Sterling for every hundred Pounds, ſo that a Man worth four hundred Pounds here, is worth ſix hundred Pounds there, without ſweating.</p>

I have made ſeveral Purchaſes, and in Pay and Preſents they have received at leaſt twelve hundred Pounds of me. Our humanity has obliged them ſo far, that they generally leave their Guns at home, when they come to our Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; they offer us no affront, not ſo much as to one of our Dogs; and if any of them break our Laws, they ſubmit to be puniſhed by them: And to this they have tyed themſelves by an Obligation under their Hands.

                  <head>Of the ſeaſons of Going, and uſual time of Paſſage.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Though Ships go hence all times of the Year,<note place="margin">The ſeaſons of the Ships Paſſage.</note> it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that to go ſo as to arrive at Spring or Fall, is beſt: For the Summer may be of the hotteſt for freſh Comers; and in the Winter the Wind that prevails, is the North-Weſt, and that blows off the Coaſt; ſo that ſometimes it difficult to enter the Capes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I purpoſe therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle of the Months call'd <hi>February</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which (allowing two Months for Paſſage) reaches time enough to plant in the Spring ſuch things as are carried hence to plant; and in the Fall, to get a ſmall Cottage, and clear ſome Land againſt the next Spring. I have made a diſcovery of about a hundred Miles Weſt, and find thoſe back-Lands richer in Soil, Woods and Fountains, than that by <hi>Delaware,</hi> eſpecially upon the <hi>Saſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanah</hi> River.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:199140:77"/>
                  <p>3. I muſt confeſs, I prefer the Fall to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as believing it moſt healthy to be followed with Winter than Summer; though (through the great goodneſs and mercy of God) we have had an extraordinary portion of Health for ſo new and numerous a Colony, notwithſtanding we have not been ſo regular in time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Paſſage is not to be ſet by any Man, for Ships will be quicker and ſlower; ſome having been four Months, and ſome but one: and as often generally between ſix and nine Weeks: One Year, or four and twenty Sail, I think, there was not three above nine, and there was one or two under ſix Weeks in Paſſage.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To render it more healthy; it is good to keep as much upon Deck as may be, for the Air helps againſt the offenſive ſmells of a crowd, and a cloſe place. Alſo to ſcrape often the Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry ſtore of Rue and Wormwood, and ſome Roſemary, or often ſprinkle Vinegar about the Cabbin. Pitch burnt is not amiſs ſometimes, againſt faintneſs and infectious Scents. I ſpeak my experience, for their benefit and direction that may need it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe ſome has urged my coming back, as an argument againſt the place, and the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of its improvement; adding, that I would for that reaſon never return: I think fit to ſay, That next Summer (God willing) I intend to go back, and carry my Family and the beſt part of my perſonal Eſtate with me. And this I do not not only of Duty, but Inclination and Choice. God will bleſs and proſper poor <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude with this further notice, That to the end ſuch as are willing to embrace any of the foregoing Propoſitions, for the improvement
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:199140:77"/> of Adventurers Eſtates, may not be diſcouraged from an inability to find ſuch Landlords, Tenants, Maſters and Servants, if they intimate that deſire to my Friend <hi>Philip Ford,</hi> living in <hi>Bow-lane</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> they may in all probability be well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; few of any quality or capacity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Province, that do not inform him of their inclination and condition.</p>
                  <p>Now for you that think of going, thither, I have this to ſay, by way of Caution. <q>If an hair of our heads fall not to the ground, without the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, remember your removal is of greater moment.

Go clear in yourſelves, and of all others. Be moderate in Expectation, count on Labour before a Crop, and Coſt before Gain; for ſuch Perſons will beſt endure difficulties, if they come and bear the ſucceſs, as well as find the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that uſually follows ſuch conſiderate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOntſerrat</hi> is a Iſland of a ſmall extent,<note place="margin">Its Extent.</note> being not above Ten Miles long, and Nine broad. It was ſo called by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at their diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it, from a Mountain therein, which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that of <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> near <hi>Barcelona,</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> It is Situated in the Latitude of ſeventeen degrees on this ſide the Line.<note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> 'Tis very much inclined to Mountains, which for the moſt part are very well cloathed with Cedar and other uſeful Trees; the Valleys and Plains being likewiſe very pleaſant and fruitful. 'Tis chiefly Inhabited by <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inhabitants.</note> intermixed with ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> making together about ſeven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Perſons. There is in it a very fair Church, of a delightful Structure, built by the liberal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of the Governour and Inhabitants; the Pulpit, Seats, and all the reſt of the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Joyners Work, being framed of the moſt precious ſweet-ſented Wood of its own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:199140:78"/>
               <p>There is ſometimes taken upon the Coaſt of this Iſland, a ſtrange kind of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,<note place="margin">A ſtrange Monſter.</note> about four Foot long, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable in bulk, having on its Head a great bunch like an Hedghog; his Skin hard and rough, like that of a Sea-Dog; of a black colour,; his Head is flat, having on the upper part of it many little riſings, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them two very ſmall black Eyes; his Mouth is very wide, his Teeth ſharp, and two of them crooked like a Boars; he has two Finns, and a broad forked Tail; all which renders him of ſo terrible a look, that they call him the Sea-Devil; which Name was given it chiefly upon his having two liltle black Horns, growing above the Eyes, turning towards his Back like a Rams; his Fleſh is ſoft, full of ſtrings, and of a poyſonous quality, cauſing ſtrange Vomitings and Swoonings, which prove mortal, if not timely prevented by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Antidote.</p>
               <p>Another, called the <hi>Sea-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sea-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn.</note> is no leſs wonderful; ſome of them being eighteen Foot long, of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Vermilion colour; the Body covered with blew Scales, (intermix'd in ſome places with white) about the bigneſs of a Crown piece; it hath ſix large Finns, like the end of Galley Oars; a Head like a Horſe, and a fair ſtreight Horn, about nine Foot long, iſſuing out of the fore-part of it, wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmaller and ſmaller to the very point; which is ſo exceeding hard and ſharp, that it will pierce through the hardeſt Bodies; its Feſh is delicate Meat, and its Body ſo large, that three Hundred Perſons are reported to have fed upon one taken in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:199140:79"/>
               <p>But none of thoſe Sea Monſters, that are eata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are ſo much in eſteem as a certain Fiſh, called by the <hi>French, Lamantine,</hi> or <hi>Manaty;</hi> ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are eighteen Foot long, having a Head like a Cow, and is therefore called the <hi>Sea-Cow;</hi> it hath a thick dark coloured Skin, ſomewhat hairy, which when dried, ſerves for a defence againſt the Arrows of the <hi>Indians;</hi> inſtead of Finns they have two ſhort Feet, which ſeem much too weak for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſo heavy a Body; he lives upon what grows on the Rocks, and in ſhallow places. where there is not much Water.</p>
               <p>Upon this Coaſt likewiſe are often ſeen great numbers of Fiſhes which Fly fifteen or twenty Foot above Water,<note place="margin">Flying Fiſh.</note> and near one Hundred Paces in length, but no more, in regard their Wings are dried by the Sun; they are ſomewhat like Herrings, but of a rounder Head and broader Back; their Wings like a Bats; in their flight they often ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sails of Ships, and fall, even in the day time, upon the Decks, and ſome report them to be very good Meat; the occaſion of their flying, is, to avoid danger from greater Fiſhes; but they meet with Enemies in the Air, as well as Water, having open hoſtility with certain Sea-Fowl, which living only upon prey, ſeize them as they fly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sword-Fiſh</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Sword-Fiſh.</note> is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, as well as the <hi>Flying-Fiſh;</hi> it hath at the end of the upper Jaw a defenſive weapon, about the breadth of a great broad Sword, which hath ſharp hard Teeth on both ſides; ſeveral of theſe Swords are five Foot long, and about ſix Inches broad towards the lower end; with ſeven and twenty white ſolid Teeth in each rank, and the bulk of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:199140:79"/> anſwering thereto; the Head of this Monſter is flat, and hideous to behold, being in form of a Heart, having near their Eyes two vents, at which they caſt out the Water they have ſwallowed; they have no Scales, but a grayiſh Skin on the Back, and white under the Belly, which is rough like a File; they have ſeven Finns, two on each Side, two on the back, and one which ſerves them for a Tail: Some call them <hi>Saw-Fiſhes,</hi> and others <hi>Emperours;</hi> becauſe there is always open War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Whale, which is very often wounded to death by their terrible weapon.</p>

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:199140:80"/>
               <p>Before the diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> there were not found in theſe Parts any <hi>Horſes, Kine, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Swine,</hi> or <hi>Dogs;</hi> but for the better conveniency of their Navigations, and ſupply of their Ships, in caſe of neceſſity, they left ſome of theſe Creatures in ſeveral Parts of this New-found World; where they have ſince multiplied and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo numerous, that they are more common than in any Part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides theſe Forreign kind of Cattel, there were before in theſe Iſlands cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſorts of ſtrange four footed Beats;<note place="margin">Their Beaſts <hi>and</hi> Cattel.</note> as, the <hi>Opaſſum,</hi> about the bigneſs of a Cat, with a ſharp Snout, the neither Jaw being ſhorter than the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, like a Pigs; it hath very ſharp Claws, and climbs Trees eaſily, feeding upon Birds, and (in want thereof) upon Fruit; it is remarkable for a purſe or bag of its own Skin, folded together under its Belly, wherein it carries its Young, which he lays upon the ground at pleaſure, by opening that natural purſe; and when he would depart, he opens it again, and the Young ones get in, and he carries them with him where-ever he goes; the Female ſuckles them without ſetting them on the ground, for her Teates lie within that purſe; they commonly bring ſix Young ones; but the Male, who hath ſuch another natural purſe under his Belly, takes his turn to carry them, to eaſe the Female.</p>
               <p>There is alſo in ſome of theſe Iſlands a kind of wild Swine, with ſhort Ears, almoſt no Tail, and their Navels on their Backs; ſome of them are all black, others have certain white ſpots; their ſtrange grunting is more hideous than that of Swine; they are called <hi>Javaris;</hi> the fleſh is of taſte
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:199140:80"/> good enough, but very hardly taken, in regard the Boar is in a manner unwearied, by reaſon of a vent or hole he hath on his Back, by which his Lungs are mightily refreſhed; and if he be forced (when he is purſued by Dogs) to ſtop, he is arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch ſharp and cutting Tuſhes, that he tearts to pieces all that ſet upon him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tatous</hi> is another ſtrange Creature, armed with a hard ſcaly coat, wherewith they cover and ſecure themſelves, as with armour; having a Head and Snout like a Pig, wherewith they turn up the ground; they have alſo in each Paw five very ſharp Claws, which help them to thruſt out the Earth with the more eaſe, and pull up the Roots whereupon they feed in the night time; they have in their Tail a ſmall bone, which is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to help deafneſs, and noiſe, and pains in the Ears; they are about the bigneſs of a Fox, and their fleſh is accounted delicate Meat; when they are purſued or ſleep, which is uſually in the day time, they cloſe themſelves cloſe up together like a Bowl, and get in their Feet, Head and Ears with ſo much dexterity under their hard Scales, that their whole Body is by that natural armour ſecured againſt all the attempts of Huntſmen and Dogs; and when at any time they come near any preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, or ſteep hill, they roul down without get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any harm.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe the <hi>Agouty,</hi> another Creature of a dark colour, with a little Tail, without Hair, having two Teeth only in each Jaw; it holds its meat in the two fore-Claws like a Squirrel, and its uſual cry is, as if it diſtinctly pronounced the word <hi>Covey;</hi> when it is hunted, it gets into hollow Trees, out of which it is not to be forced but by ſmoak, making a hideous cry before they will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:199140:81"/> leave the holes in which they are gotten; if taken while young, they are eaſily tamed; but if old, with exceeding difficulty; when they are angry, they ſtrike the ground with their hind-feet like a Rabbet, being about the ſame bigneſs and ſhape, only their Ears are ſhort and round; 'tis a fierce Creature, and its hair (when angry) ſtands per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly upright.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe <hi>Musk-Rats,</hi> which live in holes and boroughs like Rabbets; there comes from them a ſcent like Musk, which cauſes melancholly, and ſo ſtrongly perfumes their boroughs, that it is eaſie to find them out.</p>
               <p>But of all the Creatures which this Iſland pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, the <hi>Alegator</hi> is the moſt remarkable; it keeps near the Sea, and in Rivers, and Iſlands un-inhabited, and ſometimes likewiſe on ſhore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Reeds; it is a Creature very fearful to behold, and grows to the very laſt day of its life; ſo that many of them are eighteen Foot long, and as big about as a Hogſhead; their lower Jaws are immoveable, but their Mouth is ſo wide, and their Teeth ſo exceeding ſharp, that they can with eaſe bite a Man in two: Thoſe that are bred in freſh Water ſmell of Musk, and that ſo ſtrongly, that they perfume the very Air an hundred Paces round about them, and ſcent the very Water in which they live; thoſe of them that live in the Sea have not ſo ſtrong a ſcent, however both kinds are exceeding dangerous to ſuch as ſwim in thoſe Parts; they are always very ſly, and make uſe of a cunning ſlight for the ſeizing Horſes and Cows, it being their cuſtom to lye lurking at the places where uſually they come to drink, watching his advantage; and having half ſhut his eyes, ſloats upon the top of the Water like a piece of rotten
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:199140:81"/> Wood, by which means he gets by ſmall degrees ſtill nearer to the poor Beaſt, and while he is drinking, without the leaſt dread of ſuch an Enemy, ſuddenly ſeizes him by the lips, dragging him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water until he is drown'd, after which he eats him.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe ſometimes ſurprizes Men by the ſame ſlight; for one who was a Servant to the Conſul of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> going to take up one of them, thinking it had been a piece of Wood, was ſuddenly ſeized on, and drawn by it to the bottom of the River, and never ſeen more.</p>

                  <hi>BArbada</hi> is ſituated in 17 degrees and a half of Northern Latitude;<note place="margin">Situation.</note> of no great extent, not exceeding fifteen Miles in length, and of no great account to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are the Poſſeſſors of it; yet it is found to be of a fertile Soyl, well ſtored with Cattel and Sheep, and might produce ſeveral good Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities were it well manag'd, to the advantage of the Inhabitants. But it is ſubject to one great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, as well as ſome others of thoſe Iſlands, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Caribeans</hi> of <hi>Dominica,</hi> and other places,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199140:82"/> make frequent Incurſions, and commit great Spoils in it; the enmity and averſion which thoſe <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> have received againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, be ſo great &amp; irreconcilable, that there ſeldom paſſeth a Year wherein they do not make an Erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into ſome one or other of theſe Iſlands; and if not preſently diſcovered, and vigorouſly oppoſed at their firſt Landing, do much miſchief, deſtroying all before them with Fire and Sword, except the Women and Children, which, together with the Spoil and Plunder, they carry off to their own Territories.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caribeans,</hi> who Inhabit divers of thoſe Iſlands, are generally thought to have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven by their Enemies from the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and forced to take ſhelter here, having amongſt themſelves various and very different Opinions, Cuſtoms and Ceremonies; ſuch as live near, and converſe with the Chriſtians, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh'd many of their ancient barbarous Uſages, and have very much civiliz'd their Converſations; which gave occaſion to two ancient <hi>Caribeans</hi> to entertain ſome of the <hi>European</hi> Chriſtians with this or the like Diſcourſe. <q>Our People are now quite degenerated from what they formerly were, and in a manner become juſt like yours; and ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are we now grown from what we were before, that we find it a matter of ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for us to know ourſelves. To which dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of ours, attribute thoſe furious Hurricanes which happen now more frequently, than they were wont to do in the Days of Old.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are handſom, well-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, of a ſmiling Countenance, their Eyes and Hair are black, their Foreheads and Noſes flat, being cruſhed down by their Mothers, at the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199140:82"/> time of their Birth, and all the time of their Sucking, becauſe they imagine that flatneſs to be a kind of beauty and perfection: Their Feet are large and thick, and ſo exceeding hard, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they go bare-foot, neither ſhall you ſee any of them blind, lame, crook-back'd, bald, or having any other natural infirmity. Such Scars and Deformities as they get in the Wars, they glory in, as evident demonſtrations of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Their Hair is ſtrait and long, the Women attributing the higheſt excellency to that which exceeds in blackneſs; both Men and Women tye up their Hair behind, which they bind ſo hard, that it ſtands up upon their Heads like a horn, but hangs looſe upon the top; it falls down again on each ſide of their Heads. The Men, ſo ſoon as their Beards begin to grow, pluck them up by the roots, accounting it a great deformity to the <hi>Europeans</hi> to wear any: both Men and Women go naked, and if any ſhould ſo much as endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to touch their Privy-Parts, all the reſt will deride them: and thoſe who converſe amongſt the Chriſtians, though they are much civilized, and have forſaken many of their odd and barbarous Cuſtoms, yet no perſwaſion can prevail with them to relinquiſh this.</p>
               <p>They generally ſay, they came naked into the World, and it will be a madneſs for them to hide the bodies nature has beſtowed upon them; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which they change the natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their skins, by dying them with a red Compoſition, which they make for that purpoſe, and wherewith they always anoint themſelves after waſhing; and many times, to make themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more gallant, as they imagine, they draw black Circles about their Eyes with the Juyce of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper-Apples;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:199140:83"/> and when they would appear more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant than ordinary, put on a Crown of Feathers of different colours, and hang Fiſh-bones, or Buck, made of Gold, Siver, or Tin, in their Ears, and ſome of them make holes through their Lips, or in the ſpace between their Noſtrils, wherein they hang Rings, Fiſh-bones, or ſome ſuch Toys, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their gallantry; and ſome of the better ſort wear Necklaces of <hi>Amber, Coral, Criſtal,</hi> or ſome ſuch kind of glittering ſtuff.</p>
               <p>There grows in this Iſland great ſtore of excellent Fruits,<note place="margin">Their Fruits.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. Oranges, Pomegranates, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, Raiſins, Indian-Figgs,</hi> and <hi>Coco-Nuts,</hi> that famous Fruit whereof ſome Hiſtorians tell ſuch Miracles; the Nut grows upon the very trunk or top of the Tree, which is never found without Fruit, for it bears new every Month: when the Nut is broke, which is very large, (many of them weighing above ten pound) the Fruit appears as white as Snow, extreamly nouriſhing, and in taſte much like an <hi>Almond,</hi> in the middle whereof there lies a clear Liquor, ſo exceeding pleaſant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious in taſte, that many prefer it before the beſt <hi>Florence</hi>-Wine. One of them affords Meat enough to fill a good large Diſh withal. Beſides which, there are divers excellent Trees and Woods,<note place="margin">Their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</note> as <hi>Brazil, Ebony,</hi> and the like; <hi>Caſſia, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Cotton, Pepper, Tobacco, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico, Ginger, Potatoes, Pine-Apples,</hi> and <hi>Sugar-Canes,</hi> grow likewiſe there in great plenty; and a certain living or ſenſible Plant, eſteemed one of the admirableſt rarities in the World, which, as ſoon as touch'd with the hand, falls down, and the Leaves run together, as if they were ſuddenly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:199140:83"/> but, ſo ſoon as the hand is removed, and the party gone, it preſently riſes up and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again; from whence it is called, by ſome, <hi>The Chaſte Plant,</hi> in regard it will not endure to be touched, without expreſſing its reſentments of its injury.</p>
               <p>There are not many venomous Creatures<note place="margin">Venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> to be found in this Iſland, nor in any of the <hi>Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> but yet there are many Snakes and Serpents of many colours and forms, ſome whereof are nine or ten foot long, and near as big as a Man's thigh; one whereof being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a whole Hen, feathers and all, were found in her belly, beſides a dozen Eggs, upon which the Hen was ſitting when the Serpent ſeized her, which ſhews them to be very large; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are not poyſonous, but pleaſure the inhabitants by freeing their Houſes from Rats and other ſuch like Vermine, which they kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. There is another ſort of Serpent, above an Ell long, and not above an Inch about, which feed upon Frogs and Birds, and are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſo lovely green, that they are very delightful to the eye. But there are two ſorts of Snakes that are very hurtful and dangerous; the firſt is gray on the back, and feels ſoft like Velvet; the other is either yellow or red, very dreadful to look on, their heads being flat and broad, and their jaws exceeding wide, and armed with eight or ten teeth as ſharp as Needles, from whence they produce their poyſon, which lies in little purſes near the roots of their teeth; they do not chew their Food, (but ſwallow it down whole) for if they ſhould, the inhabitants ſay, they would poyſon themſelves: they are ſo exceeding veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:199140:84"/> that if a man chance to be hurt by them, if help be not immediately had, the wound in two hours proves incurable: nor have they any other vertue, that deſerves commendation, but this, they never hurt any man, which doth not firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt them.</p>

               <p>The Earth in thoſe Iſles is exceeding fertile, yielding two Crops every Year,<note place="margin">Fertility.</note> which they generally gather in about the Months <hi>July</hi> and <hi>December.</hi>

At their firſt coming aſhore they found themſelves ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by a vaſt variety of <hi>Fowl,</hi> which were taken without difficulty, no leſs than one thouſand of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:199140:86"/> one kind, ſomewhat bigger than a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> being caught by them in two or three hours ſpace: this ſort of Fowl lay ſpeckled Eggs, as large as Hens, on the Sand, and this they do every day, without being frighted, though Men ſit down by them. The greateſt inconveniency that attends the place, is their want of freſh Water; there is none for their occaſions, but what is to be found in Wells Pits, there being neither Fountain nor Stream in all theſe Iſles.</p>
               <p>The Sky is almoſt continually ſerene and clear, and the Air<note place="margin">Air.</note> ſo exceeding temperate and healthy, that it is rare to hear of a Man's dying of any other diſtemper than that of Old Age, which has occaſioned many to remove from <hi>England</hi> thither, barely for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a long and healthful Life, and when they have continued there for any conſiderable time, they are exceeding fearful of removing out of ſo good an Air, leſt it ſhould haſten their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval to the grave: However, when the Sky is at any time darkened with Clouds, it Thunders and Lighten, and the Weather proves exceeding ſtormy and tempeſtuous, the Wind ſometimes rather thundering than blowing from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for forty eight hours together. The North and North-Weſt Winds cauſe Winter in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, January,</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> which is however ſo very moderate, that young Birds and Fruits, and other Concomitants of the Spring are ſeen there in thoſe Months.

               <p>No venomous Beaſts<note place="margin">Beaſts.</note> are to be found in this Iſland, neither will they live, if brought thither; their Spiders are no way poyſonous, but are of ſundry and various co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and in hot weather make their Webs ſo exceeding ſtrong that the ſmall Birds are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entangled and caught therein.</p>
               <p>There grows in this Iſland a ſort of <hi>Ceder-trees,</hi>

The Iſland is exceeding ſtrong, and defended as it were with a kind of natural Fortification, being ſo fenced about with Rocks, that without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Paſſages, a Boat of ten Tun cannot be brought into the Haven, although, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a skilful Pilot, there is entrance for Ships of the greateſt burden.

               <p>In the Year 1616, which is four Years after the firſt ſettling there, Captain <hi>Tucker</hi> is ſent over with a new Supply, whereupon they applied themſelves the more earneſtly to the planting of <hi>Corn, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> and other <hi>Commodities,</hi> ſo that, in about three Years, thoſe Iſles began to gain ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in <hi>England,</hi> that the improving them became a publick buſineſs, many great Lords and Perſons of Quality intereſting themſelves therein, as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:199140:87"/> whereupon Captain <hi>Buttler,</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched thither with a new Supply of 500 Men, about which time the Iſle was divided into Tribes or Counties, and the whole reduced to a ſettled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, both in Church and State; after which, things ſucceeded ſo well, that it has been ever ſince growing to greater perfection.</p>

So that no Money can be raiſed, or Law made, without the conſent of the Inhabitants or their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.

               <p>This Colony was firſt ſettled in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1670. by the Lords Proprietors, who did, at their ſole charge, furniſh out three Ships with a conſiderable number of able Men, and eighteen Months Proviſion, together with Cloth, Tools, Ammunition, and whatſoever elſe was thought neceſſary for this new Settlement; and continued for ſeveral years after to ſupply the place with all things neceſſary, until the Inhabitants were, by their own induſtry, able to live of themſelves; in which condition they have now been for divers years paſt, and are arrived to a very great degree of plenty, ſo that moſt ſorts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are cheaper there than in any other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies.</p>

Upon the Point of Land, which divides thoſe two Rivers, the Proprietors, in the Year 1680. ordered the Port-Town, that ſhould ſerve for them both, to be built, calling it <hi>Charles</hi>-Town, which is ſince conſiderably advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to the number of near two hundred Houſes, more being daily raiſing by perſons of all ſorts, that repair thither from the more Northern <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:199140:89"/> Colonies in the Sugar-Iſlands, beſides thoſe that go from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> many perſons who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe went thither Servants, having, ſince their times were out, gotten good ſtocks of Cattel and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of their own, built themſelves Houſes, and exerciſe their Trades. Many that went thither in that condition, being now worth ſeveral hundred Pounds, living in a very plentiful condition, and continually adding to, and increaſing their Eſtates; ſo that Land is already become of that value, near the Town, that it is ſold for twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and not cleared of the reſt. And the Land that is cleared and fitted for planting, and fenced, is let for ten Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> the Acre, though twenty Miles diſtance from the Town; and ſix Men will, in ſix Weeks time, fell, clear, fence in, and fit it for planting. At this Town, as ſoon as its Foundations were well laid, there Rode, at one time, ſixteen Sail of Ships, (ſome whereof car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried above two hundred Tun) that came from divers Parts of the King's Dominions, to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick there, which great concourſe of Shipping will undoubtedly make it a conſiderable Town of Trade.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:199140:90"/> that went over, and he was ſeventy five years of Age before he came their; inſomuch that divers from the <hi>Bermudas</hi> removed thither, though they could never be prevailed upon to forſake that for any other Countrey than <hi>Carolina;</hi> where there is a fairer Proſpect both of Health, Pleaſure and Profit than in any other place in all the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> ſeveral perſons who went out of <hi>England</hi> ſickly and conſumptive, having preſently upon their Arrival there, recovered their health.</p>
               <p>The Soyl is generally very fruitful,<note place="margin">Its Fertility.</note> and beſides what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Climate, produces good <hi>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats</hi> and <hi>Peaſe, Turnips, Carrots, Parſnips</hi> and <hi>Potatoes,</hi> and near twenty ſorts of <hi>Pulſe</hi> which we have not in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that our <hi>Garden-Bean</hi> is not regarded there.</p>
               <p>Near the Sea, the Trees<note place="margin">The Trees.</note> are not very large, but further up they are bigger, and grow further aſunder, and ſo free from Under-wood, than you may ſee near half a Mile between the Bodies of thoſe Trees, whoſe tops meeting, make a pleaſing ſhade without hindering the Graſs, Mirtle, and other ſweet-ſented Shrubs from growing under them. There grow beſides the <hi>Cedar, Cypreſs</hi> and the like, the <hi>Oak, Aſh, Elm, Poplar, Beech,</hi> and all other uſeful Timber.</p>
               <p>Their Woods likewiſe abound with <hi>Hares, Squirrels, Racoons,</hi>

They have likewiſe plenty of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Hogs,</hi> both which increaſe wonderfully there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carolina</hi> doth ſo well abound with Rivers,<note place="margin">Its Rivers.</note> that within fifty miles of the Sea, you can ſcarcely place your ſelf ſeven miles from one that is navigable; and ſome of them are navigable for big Veſels above three hundred miles up into the Countrey. Their Rivers and Brooks abound with great variety of excellent Fiſh, and near the Sea with good Oyſters, in ſome whereof Pearls are often found.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a perfect Friendſhip with the Natives, and the Proprietors have taken care that no injuſtice ſhall be done them; a particular Court of Judicature compos'd of the ſobereſt and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted Perſons being eſtabliſhed by their order, to determine all differences that ſhall happen between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and them. They are a People of a ready wit, and though illiterate, are generally found to be of a good underſtanding. For their keeping an account of Time, they make uſe of Hieroglyphicks, and inſtruct their Children in ſuch matters as relate to their Family and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which is ſo preſerved from one generation to another. Where a Battel hath been fought, or a Colony ſetled, they raiſe a ſmall Pyramid of Stones, conſiſting of the number of the ſlain, or thoſe ſetled at the Colony; and for Religious Rites, as Sacrifices, Burials, and the like, they make round Circles with Straws or Reeds, by the differing placing whereof, it is known for
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:199140:91"/> what it is made; and to meddle with any of thoſe Circles, is accounted by them no better than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege.</p>
               <p>They are generally well proportioned, and ſo well affected to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they are ready upon all occaſions to contribute their Aſſiſtance to them; they are generally of a good and honeſt meaning, being no ways addicted to Vice or any Extravagancies, and always content themſelves with a mean Diet and Apparel for their preſent ſubſiſtance, without taking much care for the time to come. They are much addicted to Mirth and Dancing, and to Acts of Courage and Valour, which they prefer above all other Virtues, and are therefore almoſt continually engaged in War, one Town or Village againſt another; their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments generally being of no greater extent; and that ſide which Fortune crowns with Victory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with triumphant Jollities: By which means ſeveral Nations have been in a manner quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſince our firſt Settlement at <hi>Aſhley</hi> River; which keeps them ſo thin of People, and ſo divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among themſelves, that were they leſs affected to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet they would have no reaſon to entertain the leaſt apprehenſions of Danger from them, being already too ſtrong for all the <hi>Indians</hi> that inhabit within five hundred miles of them, if they were perfectly united; which the <hi>Indians</hi> know ſo well, that they will never adventure to fall out with them, nor offer the leaſt injury to any of thy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:199140:92"/> which they fancy he commits to the Government of leſs Deities, that is, to good and evil Spirits, to whom their inferior Prieſts make their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sacrifices. They believe the tranſmigration of Souls; and when any of them die, their Friends inter with their Corps Proviſions and Houſhold-ſtuff for their <hi>Elizium</hi> Shades, which they imagine to be beyond the Mountains from the <hi>Indian</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. They are very ſuperititious in their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and from a ſtrange kind of Belief which is entertained amongſt them, that from four Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only all Mankind ſprang: They divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the like number of Tribes, and have four Burying-places; believing it to be a wicked and ominous thing to mingle their Bodies even when dead.</p>
               <p>The Lords Proprietors do immediately grant to all perſons that come thither to inhabit, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing terms; for each Maſter or Miſtreſs of a Family, fifty Acres of Land, and for every able Son or Man-ſervant that they carry, or cauſe to be carried thither, fifty Acres more, and the like for each Daughter and Woman-Servant that is marriageable, and for every Child or Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Servant under the Age of Sixteen, forty Acres, and fifty to each Servant ſo ſoon as their Time with their Maſter is expired; which Land is to be enjoyed by them and their heirs for ever, upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only one penny an Acre as a Quit-Rent to the Lords Proprietors, which is not to commence neither till two years after their firſt taking up their Land.</p>
               <p>And in regard ſome who have already ſetled themſelves at <hi>Carolina,</hi> and others that intend to go thither, are deſirous to ſecure to themſelves large convenient Tracts of Land, without being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

Travelling through a Wood, a Deer ſeized by a wild Cat, croſſed their way, almoſt ſpent with the Burden and Cruelty of his Rider, who having faſtned upon his Shoulder, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſucking his Blood till the poor Beaſt fell down under her; which one of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> perceiving, ſhot an Arrow at the wild Cat, which wounding her under the Belly, made her leave her Prey, which was already ſlain, and run towards them with a fierce and dreadful Look; but her wound being mortal, her ſtrength and ſpirits failed before ſhe reached them; whereby they eſcaped her revenge, which peradventure otherwiſe ſome of them might have felt. This Creature is ſomewhat larger than a Fox, of a kind of a reddiſh gray Colour, and in figure every way like an ordinary Cat, but exceeding fierce, raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo cunning, that knowing the Deer, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they chiefly prey, to be two ſwift for them, they lurk upon Branches of Trees, and as the Deer walk and feed under them, ſuddenly jump down upon their backs.

               <p>This Country was firſt diſcovered in the Year 1497.<note place="margin">Its Diſcovery.</note> by <hi>Sebaſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but his Mariners were all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore may juſtly be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us. But it was more fully diſcovered, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all that Tract of Sea-Coaſt, by Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake,</hi> and was called <hi>Virginia</hi> by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who viſited it ſoon after in honour of his Virgin Miſtris, Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In the Year 1603. divers perſons, who obtained the Propriety of it from Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> made a Voyage thither, who diſcovered <hi>Whitſon</hi>-Bay in forty one Degrees. The People uſed Snake-skins of ſix Foot long for Girdles, and were exceedingly raviſhed with the Muſick of a Gittern, a Boy dancing in a Ring about him; they were more afraid of two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtives than of twenty Men.</p>
               <p>There being much time ſpent in the diſcovery of this Country, and not without vale Expences, in the ſetting forth of Ships, and that not without the loſs of ſeveral Mens lives before it could be brought to perfection, but at length, in the Year 1607. Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> and others, ſettled a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at the Mouth of the River <hi>Saghadoc,</hi> but Captain <hi>James Davis</hi> having choſen a ſmall place, almoſt an Iſland, to ſet down in, where, having heard a Sermon, read their Patent and Laws, and, after he had built a Fort, ſailed further up the River and Country, where, finding an Iſland that had a great fall of Water, and having haled their Boat over with a Rope, they came to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall, which, by reaſon of its being very ſhallow and ſwift, proved unpaſſable; the Head of the River lying in about forty five Degrees: They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:199140:106"/> with our mens devotion, and would ſay, <hi>King</hi> James <hi>is a good King, and his God a good God, but our God</hi> Tanto <hi>a naughty God,</hi> which is the Name of the evil Spirit that haunts them every new Moon, and makes them worſhip him for fear; he commanded the <hi>Indians</hi> not to converſe, nor come near the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> threatning to kill ſome of them, if they did, and inflict ſickneſs upon others, if they diſobey'd him, beginning with two of their <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores</hi> or King's Children, affirming he had power to do the like againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and would the next new Moon execute it on them. In <hi>January,</hi> in the ſpace of ſeven hours, they had <hi>Thunder, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Rain, Frost</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> all in very great abundance: There is likewiſe found a <hi>Bath</hi> ſo hot for two Miles about, they cannot drink of it. One of the <hi>Indians,</hi> for a <hi>Straw-hat</hi> and <hi>Knife,</hi> ſtript himſelf of his cloathing, which was <hi>Beaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins,</hi> worth in <hi>England</hi> 50 <hi>s.</hi> or 3 <hi>l.</hi> to preſent them to the <hi>Preſident,</hi> only leaving himſelf a piece to cover his Nudities.</p>
               <p>About this time, by the induſtry of Capt. <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> and Capt. <hi>Smith, James-Town</hi> was built,<note place="margin">James-Town built.</note> the <hi>Indians</hi> ſupplying their Neceſſities, which were ſometimes very extream; the Winter approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Rivers afforded them very great plenty of <hi>Cranes, Swans, Geeſe, Ducks,</hi> wherewith they had <hi>Peaſe</hi> and wild <hi>Beaſts,</hi> &amp;c. But in the diſcovery of <hi>Chickahamine-River, George Caſſon</hi> was ſurpriſed, and <hi>Smith,</hi> with two others, beſet with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Savages,</hi> his Men ſlain, and himſelf taken Priſoner; but in about a Months time he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured not only his liberty, but was in great favour among them, being extraordinary well pleaſed with his Diſcourſes of <hi>God, Nature</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> ſo
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:199140:106"/> that he had a moſt noble Entertainment from <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan,</hi> one of their Emperours, who ſate in ſtate upon his Bed of Mats, Pillow of Leather, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Parl and white Beads, attired with Robes of Skins, as large as an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Mantle; at his Head ſate a handſom young Woman, and another at his Feet, and on each ſide the Room twenty others, their Heads and Shoulders painted red, with a great Chain of white Beads about their Necks, and a Robe of Skins, large like an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Mantle; before theſe ſate his chiefeſt Men, in their orders: In his Palace or Arbour, one <hi>Newport,</hi> who accompanied Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> gave the Emperour a Boy, in requital whereof <hi>Powhatan</hi> beſtowed upon him <hi>Namontack</hi> his Servant, who was afterwards brought into <hi>England;</hi> yet after this <hi>Powhatan</hi> treacherouſly contrived the Murder of ſixteen of of our Men, which was happily prevented by Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> who ſeized another of their Kings, and thereby obtained Peace with them upon his own Terms.</p>
               <p>This Emperour had about thirty Kings under him, his chief Treaſure conſiſting of <hi>Skins, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Pearls, Beads,</hi> and the like, all which were kept in ſtore againſt his Burial, being reſerved on purpoſe againſt that time; his Houſe being fifty or ſixty Yards long, frequented only by Prieſts; at the four Corners ſtood four Images, as Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, one of a <hi>Bear,</hi> another a <hi>Dragon,</hi> the third a <hi>Leopard,</hi> and the fourth a <hi>Giant:</hi> He hath as many Women as he pleaſes, whom, after he is grown weary of, he beſtows upon his Favorites. His Will, with the Cuſtom of the Country, are his Laws, puniſhing his Malefactors by broiling to death, incloſed about with fire, with ſeveral other Tortures. About ten Miles from <hi>James-Town</hi> one
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:199140:107"/> of their Kings made a Feaſt in the Woods, the people being moſt monſtroully painted, ſome like black Devils, with Horns, and their Hair looſe, of variety of colours; they continued two days dancing in a Circle of a quarter of a Mile about, four in a rank, in two companies, exerciſing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Antick Tricks, the King leading the Dance; all in the midſt had black Horns on their Heads, and green Boughs in their Hands; next whom were four or five principal Men, differently paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who with Clubs beat thoſe forward that tired in the Dance, which held ſo long, that they were ſcarce able either to go or ſtand; they made a helliſh noiſe, and throwing away their Boughs, ran clapping their Hands up into a Tree, and tearing down a Branch, fell into their order again. After this, fifteen of their proper Boys, between ten and fiften years old, painted white, were brought forth to the people, who ſpent the Forenoon in ſporting and dancing about them with Rattles; then, the Children being fetched away, the Women wept, and paſſionately cried out, providing <hi>Moſs, Skins, Mats</hi> and <hi>dry Wood,</hi> making Wreaths for their Heads, and decking their Hair with Leaves; after which, they were all caſt on a heap in a Valley as dead, where a great Feaſt was made for all the company for two hours; they then fell again into a Circle, and danced about the Youths, cauſing a Fire to be made on an Altar, which our Men thought was deſigned to ſacrifice them to the Devil, but it was a miſtake, and the <hi>Indians</hi> deluded our Men by falſe ſtories, one denying, and another af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the ſame thing, being either ignorant or unwilling to diſcover the deviliſh Myſteries of their Religion; but a King being demanded the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Sacrifice, anſwered, <hi>That the Children
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:199140:107"/> were not all dead, but the</hi> Okee, <hi>or the Devil, did ſuck the Blood from their left Breast, till ſome of them died, but the rest were kept in the Wilderneſs, till nine Moons were expired, during which they must not converſe with any; of theſe were made Prieſts and Conjurers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They think theſe Sacrifices ſo neceſſary, that if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they believe their <hi>Okee</hi> or <hi>Devil,</hi> &amp; their other Gods would hinder them from having any Deer, Turkies, Corn or Fiſh, and would likewiſe make a great Slaughter among them. They imagine their Prieſts after Death, go beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains toward the Sun-Setting, and remain there continually in the ſhape of their <hi>Okee,</hi> having their Heads painted with Oyl, and finely trimmed with Feathers, and being furniſed with Beads, Hatchets, Copper and Tobacco, never ceaſe to dance and ſing with their Predeceſſors; yet they ſuppoſe the common People ſhall die like Beaſts, and never live after Death: Some of their Prieſts were ſo far convinced, that they declared our God exceeded theirs, as much as our Guns did their Bows and Arrows, and ſent many Preſents to the Preſident, intreating him to pray to his God for Rain, for their God would not ſend them any. By Break of Day, before they eat or drink, the Men, Women and Children above ten years old, run into the Water, and there waſh a good ſpace, till the Sun ariſe; then they offer Sacrifice to it, ſtrewing Tobacco on the Land and Water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame Ceremony at Sun-Set. <hi>George Caſſon</hi> aforementioned, was ſacrificed, as they thought, to the Devil, being ſtript naked, and bound to two ſtakes, with his Back againſt a great Fire; after which they ript up his Belly, and burnt his Bowels, drying his Fleſh to the Bones, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:199140:108"/> they kept above ground in a Room; many other <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were cruelly and treacherouſly executed by them, though perhaps not ſacrificed, and none had eſcaped if their Ambuſh had ſucceeded. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan</hi> invited one Captain <hi>Ratcliff</hi> and thirty others to trade for Corn, and having brought them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Ambuſh, murdered them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virginia,</hi> after its diſcovery, coſt no ſmall pains before it was brought to perfection, with the loſs of many <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> Lives. In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, a Patent was granted to ſeveral Perſons as a Corporation, and called the Company of <hi>Adventurers</hi> of <hi>Virginia.</hi> But upon ſeveral Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors and Miſcarriages in 1623. the Patent was made null; ſince which, it hath been free for all his Majeſties Subjects to Trade into theſe Parts.</p>

               <p>The Climate<note place="margin">The Climate.</note> of late is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially ſince the felling of the Woods, and the People accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diet, is very healthful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> few now dying at their firſt coming, of the Country Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or ſeaſoning; neither is the Heat extream in Summer, being much qualified by the cool and gentle Briezes of winds from the Sea, and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Showers of Rain, and the Cold in Winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo little durance, that the Inhabitants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to ſuffer by either.</p>
               <p>The Countrey is generally plain and even, yet riſing in ſome places into ſmall and pleaſant Hills, which heighten the Beauty of the adjacent Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:199140:117"/> Strong-drink, ſo that without they have enough to be drunk, they care not to drink at all; if their company be ſo great, that they have not enough to make them all drunk, they uſually chuſe ſo many as are proportionable to that quantity, and the reſt muſt be ſpectators; if any happen to be drunk, before he has taken his ſhare, which is ordinarily a quart of <hi>Brandy, Rum</hi> or <hi>Strong-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> to ſhew their Juſtice, they will pour the reſt down his Throat: in which debauches they often kill one another, which the Friends of the dead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon the Murtherer, unleſs he purchaſe his Life with Money, which is made of <hi>Periwinkle-ſhell,</hi> both black and white, ſtrung like <hi>Beads.</hi>

               <p>They obſerve ſeveral Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in their Reigious Rites,<note place="margin">Their Religion.</note> and are ſaid to Worſhip the Devil, which uſually they perform once or twice a Year, unleſs upon ſome extraordinary occaſion, as the making of War, or the like, when their <hi>Corn</hi> is ripe, which is uſually about <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> The day being appointed by their Chief Prieſt, or <hi>Pawaw,</hi> moſt of them go a Hunting for <hi>Veniſon;</hi> when they are all aſſembled, if the Prieſt wants Money, he then tells them, their God will accept no Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Money; which the People believing, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one gives according to his ability: the Prieſt takes the Money, and putting it into ſome Diſhes, ſets them upon the top of their low, flat-roofed Houſes, and ſo falls a calling upon their God, to come and receive it, which, with many loud hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and out-crys, ſtriking the ground with ſticks, and beating themſelves, is performed by the Prieſt, and ſeconded by the People. After, being thus wearied, a Devil, by his conjuration, appears amongſt them, ſometimes in the ſhape of a <hi>Fowl,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:199140:118"/> a <hi>Beast,</hi> or a <hi>Man,</hi> which ſo amazeth the people, that they dare not ſtir; the Prieſt improves the opportunity, and ſtepping out, makes ſure of the Money, and then returns to lay the Spirit, who is often gone before he comes back, having taken ſome of the company along with him; but if at ſuch times any <hi>Engliſh</hi> come among them, it puts a period to their proceedings, and they will deſire his abſence, ſaying, <hi>Their God will not come, till they are departed.</hi> They are much addicted to go to War againſt one another, but they ſight no pitch'd Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, but upon their Enemies approach, (having firſt ſecured their Wives and Children in ſome <hi>Iſland,</hi> or thick <hi>Swamp</hi>) armed with Guns and Hatchets, they way-lay their Enemy, and it's counted a great Fight when ſeven or eight are ſlain; they ſeldom give quarter to any, but the Women and Children, whom they reſerve and make uſe of for the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>When an <hi>Indian</hi> dies, they bury him upright,<note place="margin">Their way of Burial.</note> ſitting upon a Seat, with his <hi>Gun, Money,</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> to furniſh him in the other World, which they believe to be Weſtward, where they ſhall have great ſtore of Game for Hunting, and live at eaſe; at his Funeral, his Relations paint their Faces black, making, at his Grave, once or twice every day, ſad Lamentations; thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the blackneſs is wore off their Faces; and after that, once a Year they mourn afreſh for him, viſiting and trimming up the Grave, not ſuffering any Graſs to grow near it, fencing it with a Hedge, and covering it with Mats for a ſhelter from the Rain. Notwithſtanding all this buſtle, when an <hi>Indian</hi> is dead his Name dies with him, none da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ever after to mention his Name, it being not
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:199140:118"/> only a breach of their Law, but an affront to his Friends and Relations, as if done on purpoſe to renew their grief. And every perſon, bearing the ſame Name, inſtantly changes it for another, which every one invents for himſelf; ſome call themſelves <hi>Rattleſnakes,</hi> others <hi>Buckshorn,</hi> or the like; yea, if a perſon die, whoſe Name is ſome Word uſed in common Speech, they change that Word, and invent a new one, which makes their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage very troubleſom. When any one is ſick, after his Friends have uſed all poſſible means, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one pretending skill in Phyſick, but all proving ineffectual, they ſend for a <hi>Pawaw,</hi> or Prieſt, who, ſitting down by the ſick perſon, without the leaſt inquiring after the Diſtemper, expects a Fee or Gift, according to which he proportions his work, beginning with a low voice to call ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon one God, and then on another, ſtill raiſing his vice, beating his naked breaſts and ſides till the ſweat runs down, and his breath is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gone, and what remains, he breaths upon the face of the ſick perſon three or four times together, ſo takes his leave.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings are performed without any Ceremony,<note place="margin">Their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> the Match being firſt made by Money, which being agreed on, and given to the Woman, makes a Conſummation of the Marriage, if we may ſo call it; after which, he keeps her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure, and, upon the leaſt diſlike, turns her away and takes another. It is no offence for their married Women to lie with another Man, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe acquaint her Husband, or ſome of her neareſt Relations therewith; but if not, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it ſuch a fault as is ſometimes puniſhable by death. When any Woman finds herſelf quick with
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:199140:119"/> Child, ſhe keeps herſelf chaſte, or untouched by Man, until her delivery, the like ſhe obſerveth in her giving ſuch, a ſtrange Cuſtom which our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Ladies would not well reliſh. An <hi>Indian</hi> may have two or three or more Wives if he pleaſe; but it is not now ſo much uſed, as before the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> came, they being inclined to imitate them in things both good and bad. Any Maid, before ſhe is married, lies with whom ſhe pleaſes for Money, without the leaſt ſcandal or aſperſion, it being not only cuſtomary, but lawful. They are extream charitable to one another, for if any one has to ſpare, he freely imparts to his friends, and whatever they get by Gaming, or otherwiſe, they ſhare one with another, leaving commonly the leaſt part to themſelves.</p>
               <p>When their King or <hi>Sachen</hi> ſits in Council, he hath a company of armed Men to guard his perſon, great reſpect being ſhewed him by the people, which chiefly appears by their ſilence; after he has declared the cauſe of their convention, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands their Opinions, ordering who ſhall firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who, having delivered his mind, tells them, he hath done, for no man interrupts him, though he makes never ſo many long ſtops and halts, till he ſays, he hath no more to ſay; the Council ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all delivered their Opinions, the King, after ſome pauſe, gives the definitive Sentence, which is commonly ſeconded by a ſhout from the people, thereby ſignifying their aſſent or applauſe. If any perſon be condemned to die, which is ſeldom, but for Murder, or Inceſt, the King himſelf goes out in perſon, (for they have no Priſons, and the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſon flies into the Woods) to ſeek him out, and having found him, the King ſhoots firſt, though at never ſuch a diſtance, and then happy is the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:199140:119"/> man that can ſhoot him down, who, for his pains, is made ſome Captain or Military Officer.</p>

                  <hi>Its Diſcovery. NEw-England</hi> was firſt diſcovered, as well as the other Northern-Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> by <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot,</hi> in the Year 1497. and in 1584. Mr. <hi>Philip Amadas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arthur Barlow,</hi> were the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that took poſſeſſion thereof for Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Year following Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile</hi> conveyed an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony thither, under the government of Mr. <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> who continued there till the next Year, but, upon ſome extraordinary occaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> being accounted by ſome the firſt diſcoverer thereof. It is ſeated on the North of <hi>Mary-Land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its Situation.</note> and on the South <hi>Virginia,</hi> lying about 40 and 41 Degrees of North-Latitude, and it is reported to have 70 Miles of Sea-Coſt, where are found divers good Havens, ſeveral of which being capable to harbour five hundred Sail of Ships from the rage of the Sea and Winds, by reaſon of the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſeveral Iſles (to the number of about 200) which lie about this Coaſt. The Account of the Worſhip and Ceremonies of the <hi>Indians</hi> hath been
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:199140:120"/> much perfected by the Induſtry and Voyages of Capt. <hi>Goſnold,</hi> Capt. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Smith,</hi> and others, the laſt of which gives a very large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, this Captain being taken Priſoner by the Natives, and while he ſtayed among them obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Magical Rites, three or four days after his being ſeized, ſeven of their Prieſts, in the Houſe, where he lay, each with a Rattle, (making him ſit down by them) began about Ten in the Morning to ſing about a fire, which they encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with a Circle of Meal, at the end of every Song (which the Chief Prieſt begun, the reſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in order) they laid down two or three Grains of Wheat, then the Prieſt diſguiſed with a great Skin, his Head hung round with little Skins of Weaſles, and other Vermine, and a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of Feathers, painted as ugly as the Devil, at the end of every Song he uſed ſtrange and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Geſtures, throwing great Cakes of Deer-Suet and Tobacco into the fire, thus theſe howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devotions continued till Six a Clock at Night, and held ſo three days. This they pretended was to know of their God, whether any more <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould arrive, and what they intended to do in that Country. They ſed Capt. <hi>Smith</hi> ſo high, that he much doubted they would have ſacrificed him to their Chief Deity, the Image of whom is ſo deformed, that nothing can be more monſtrous, the Women likewiſe, after he was freed and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Company made him a very odd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, thirty of them came out of the Woods, only covered before and behind with a few green Leaves, their Bodies painted of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent colours the Commander of theſe Nymphs had on her Head a large pair of Stag's Horns, and a Quiver of Arrows at her Back, with Bow and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:199140:121"/> Arrows in her hand; the reſt followed with Horns and Weapons all alike; they ruſhed through the Streets with helliſh ſhouts and crys, dancing about a fire, which was there made for that purpoſe, for an hour together; then they ſolemnly invited him to their Lodging, where he was no ſooner come, but they all ſurrounded him, and crying, <hi>Love you not me?</hi> after which they feaſted him with great variety, cook'd after their mad faſhion, ſome ſinging and dancing all the while, and at laſt lighted him home with a Firebrand, inſtead of a Torch, to his Lodgings.</p>
               <p>And although this Country is ſeated in the midſt of the <hi>Temperate Zone,</hi> yet is the Clime more uncertain,<note place="margin">Temperature.</note> as to the heat and cold, than thoſe <hi>European</hi> Kingdoms, which lie Parallel with it; and, as to <hi>Virginia,</hi> this may be compared as <hi>Scotland</hi> is to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Air<note place="margin">The Air.</note> is found very healthful, and agreeable to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which makes them poſſeſs many Potent Colonies, being very numerous and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful.</p>

The chief God they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:199140:121"/> Worſhip is the Devil, which they call <hi>Okee;</hi> they have conference with him, and faſhion themſelves into his ſhape: In their Temple they have his Image ill-favouredly Carved, Painted and Adorned with Chains, Copper and Beads, and covered with a Skin. The Sepulchre of their Kings is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near them, whoſe Bodies are firſt Imbowelled, dried on a Hurdle, adorned with Chains and Beads, and then wrapped in white Skins, over which are Matts; they are afterwards Intombed orderly in Arches made of Matts, their Wealth being placed at their feet: But for their common Burials, they dig a hole in the Earth with ſharp Stakes, and the Corps being wrapped in Skins and Matts, they lay them in the Ground, placing them upon ſticks, and then cover them with Earth; the Burial ended, the Women having their Faces painted black with <hi>Cole</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> ſit Mourning in the Houſe twenty four hours together, howling and yelling by turns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Natives</hi> are cloathed with looſe Mantles made of <hi>Deers Skins,</hi> and Aprons of the ſame round their Middle,<note place="margin">Their Cloathing.</note> all elſe being naked; of Stature like to us in <hi>England:</hi> They Paint themſelves and their Children, and he is moſt Gallant who is moſt deformed. The Women Imbroider their Legs, Hands, and other Parts, with ſeveral Works, as of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and the like, making black ſpots in their Fleſh. Their Houſes are made of ſmall Poles, round, and faſtened at the top in a circle like our Arbours, covered with Matts twice as long as broad; they are exact Archers, and with their Arrows will kill Birds flying, or Beaſts running full ſpeed: One of our Men was with an Arrow ſhot through the Body and both the Arms at once. Another <hi>Indian</hi> ſhot an Arrow of an Ell long through a Target,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:199140:122"/> that a Piſtol Ballet could not pierce; their Bows are of tough <hi>Hazle,</hi> and their Strings of <hi>Leather;</hi> their Arrows of <hi>Cane</hi> or <hi>Hazle,</hi> headed with <hi>Stones</hi> or <hi>Horn,</hi> and Feathered Artificially: They ſoon grow heartleſs, if they find their Arrows do no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. They ſay there is Men among them of above two hundred years of Age.</p>
               <p>Though the Planting of this Country was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by ſeveral of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet it lay much neglected, 'till a ſmall company of Planters, under the Command of Captain <hi>George Popham,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gilbert,</hi> was ſent over at the charge of Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> in 1606. to begin a Colony upon a Tract of Land about <hi>Saga de hoch,</hi> the moſt Northernly part of <hi>New-England,</hi> but that deſign within two years expired with its Founder. Soon after, ſome Honourable Perſons of the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> being more certainly informed of ſeveral Navigable Rivers, and Commodious Havens, with other places ſit either for Planting or Traffick, newly diſcovered by many skilful Navigators, obtained of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, a Patent under the Great Seal, of all that part of <hi>North America,</hi> called <hi>New-England,</hi> from forty to forty eight Degrees of <hi>North Latitude.</hi> This vaſt Tract of Land, was in 1612. Cantoned, and divided by Grant into many leſſer Parcels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Adventurers preſented; which Grants being founded upon uncertain and falſe Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reports of ſome that Travelled thither, did much interfere one with another, to the great diſturbance of the firſt Planters, ſo that little profit was reaped from thence: Nor was any greater Improvement made of thoſe Grand Portions of Land, ſaving the erecting ſome few Cottages for Fiſhermen, and a few inconſiderable Buildings for
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:199140:122"/> the Planters; yea, for want of good Conduct, they were by degrees in a manner quite deſtitute of Laws and Government, and left to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</p>
               <p>This was the beginning of <hi>New-England,</hi> when, in the Year 1610. one Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> a Presbyterian, or rather Independent Preacher, and ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> though they had been courteouſly entertained by the <hi>Dutch</hi> as Strangers; yet foreſeeing divers inconveniences might follow, and that they could not ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the good of their Poſterity under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Foreign Nation, they reſolve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſo much Favour of their Sovereign Prince, King <hi>James,</hi> as to grant them Liberty, under the Protection of his Royal Authority, to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome place of <hi>New-England.</hi> Having therefore obtained a Patent or Grant for ſome place about <hi>Hudſons</hi> River, they ſet Sail from <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> for the Southern Parts of <hi>New-England;</hi> but as they intended their Courſe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-ward, they were through many dangers, at laſt, about <hi>November</hi> the eleventh, caſt upon a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the South Cape of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Bay, called Cape <hi>Cod.</hi> When, Winter approached ſo faſt, that they had no opportunity to remove, and finding ſome encouragement from the hopefulneſs of the Soyl, and courteſie of the Heathen, they reſolved there to make their aboad, laying the Foundation of a new Colony, which from the laſt Town they Sailed from in <hi>England,</hi> they called <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> containing no conſiderable Tract of Land, ſcarce extending one hundred Mile in length through the whole Cape, and not half ſo much in breadth, where broadeſt.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:199140:123"/>
               <p>From this time, to the Year 1636. things were very proſperouſly and ſucceſsfully carried on in <hi>New-England,</hi> which was much increaſed in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Inhabitants; at which time, the <hi>Naragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Indians,</hi> who are the moſt Warlike and Fierce, and much dreaded by all the reſt, committed divers outrages upon ſeveral of them, and likewiſe upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> as they came occaſionally to Trade with them, barbarouſly murthering Capt. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Oldham,</hi> with ſeveral others: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Inhabitants of all the Colonies unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly falling upon them, in 1637. they were eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſſed, about ſeven hundred of them being deſtroyed, and the reſt cut off by their neighbour <hi>Indians.</hi> Upon which, <hi>Miantonimoh,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Magchins,</hi> expecting to be ſole Lord and Ruler over all the <hi>Indians,</hi> committed many Inſolencies upon ſome others, who were in Confederacy with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as himſelf; and he being ſent for to the <hi>Maſſacuſets</hi> Court, at <hi>Boſton,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clear himſelf, but was clearly convicted by one of his fellows, named <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas:</hi> In revenge of which, after his return home, he made War upon <hi>Vncas,</hi> by whom being taken Priſoner, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he cut off his Head, it being juſtly feared no firm Peace could be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded while he was alive. This happened in 1643. from whence, to 1675. there was always an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Amity and good Correſpondence on all ſides, only in 1671. one <hi>Matoonas,</hi> being vexed that an intended Deſign againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not take effect, out of meer malice againſt them, ſlew an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> on the Road; the Murtherer was a <hi>Nipnet Indian,</hi> and under the Command of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> the Author of all the miſchief againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in 1675.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:199140:123"/>
               <p>Upon a due inquiry therefore of all the Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from their firſt ſetling on theſe Coaſts, there will appear no ground of quarrel or provocation given by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For when <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony was firſt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in 1620. within three months after, <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> the chief <hi>Sachem</hi> or Commander of all that ſide of the Country, repairs thither to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and entred ſolemnly into a League upon the following Articles. 1. <hi>That neither he nor any of his ſhould injure or do any hurt to any of their People.</hi> 2. <hi>If any of his hurt the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>he ſhould ſend them the offender to puniſh.</hi> 3. <hi>If any thing ſhould be taken away by his, he ſhould ſee it reſtored, and the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to do the like to them.</hi> 4. <hi>If any made War unjuſtly againſt him, they were to aid him, and he likewiſe them.</hi> 5. <hi>That he ſhould certifie his neighbour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates hereof, that they might be likewiſe compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Peace.</hi> 6. <hi>That when his men ſhould come to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>they ſhould leave their Arms behind;</hi> which were then Bows and Arrows, and were then their only Weapons, though now they have learn- the uſe of Guns and Swords as well as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. This League the ſame <hi>Sachem</hi> confirmed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his death, in 1630. coming with his two Sons, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and renewing the ſame for Himſelf, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; yet it is apparent this <hi>Maſſaſoit</hi> never loved the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and would have ingaged them never to have attempted to draw away any of his People from their old <hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Idolatry, to the Chriſtian Religion: But finding they would make no Treaty with him upon ſuch Conditions, he urged it no further. But this was a bad Omen, that whatever kindneſs he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the <hi>Englijh,</hi> yet he hated them for being
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:199140:124"/> Chriſtians; which ſtrain was more apparent in his Son that ſucceeded him, and all the People: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that ſome diſcerning Perſons of that Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, were afraid that that part of the <hi>Indians</hi> would be all rooted out, as it is ſince come to paſs.</p>
               <p>Neither was <hi>Paſſaconaway,</hi> the great <hi>Sagamore</hi> or <hi>Sachim</hi> of <hi>Merimack</hi> River, inſenſible of the fatal conſequence of oppoſing the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for a Perſon of Quality relates, that being invited by ſome <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chims</hi> to a great Dance, in 1660. <hi>Paſſaconaway</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending at that time to make his laſt and farewel Speech to his Children and People, that were then all gathered together: He addreſſing himſelf to them in this manner. <hi>I am now going the way of all fleſh, or ready to die, and not like to ſee you meet together any more; I will now leave this word of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with you, that you take heed how you quarrel with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for though you may do them much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, yet aſſuredly you will all be deſtroyed and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off the Earth if you do: For I was as much an Enemy to them, at their firſt coming into theſe Parts, as any one whatſoever, and tryed all ways and means poſſible to have deſtroyed them, at leaſt to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them ſitting down here, but could no way ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, therefore I adviſe you never to contend with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>nor make War with them.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, his eldeſt Son, aſſoon as he perceived the <hi>Indians</hi> were up in Arms, withdrew himſelf into ſome remote place, that he might not be hurt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed, after this digreſſion; After the death of <hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> his eldeſt Son <hi>Alexander</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, about twenty years ſince, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the League he had entred into with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with his Father, in 1639. had no affection
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:199140:124"/> to them nor their Religion, but was Plotting to Riſe againſt them; whereupon a ſtout Gentleman was ſent to bring him before the Council of <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month,</hi> who found him and eight more in a Hunting-Houſe, where they were juſt come in from Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. leaving all their Guns without doors, which being ſeized by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they then entred the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and demanded <hi>Alexander</hi> to go along with them before the Governor. At which Meſſage he was much appalled, but being told that if he ſtirred or refuſed to go, he was a dead man, he was perſuaded by one of the chief Confidents to go; but ſuch was the Pride of his Spirit, that his very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation for this ſurprizal, caſt him into a Feaver, whereof he ſoon after died. After his death, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> his Brother, nick-named King <hi>Philip,</hi> for his haughty Spirit, came in his own Perſon, in 166. with <hi>Sauſaman</hi> his chief Secretary and Counſellor, to renew the former League that had been made with his Predeceſſors; and there was as much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence betwixt them, for the next ſeven years, as had ever been in former times; and yet without any kind of provocation, this treacherous Man, in 1676. harboured miſchievous thoughts againſt them, Plotting a general Inſurrection in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, all the <hi>Indians</hi> being to riſe as one man againſt the Plantations which were next them. Which being diſcovered by <hi>John Sauſaman, Philip</hi> thereupon cauſed him to be murthered; the Murtherers being apprehended, were Executed, and <hi>Philip</hi> fearing his own Head, got openly into Arms, killing, burning and deſtroying the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Habitations, with all manner of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Cruelty. Which Troubles continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two years, 'till at length, after ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats given to <hi>Philips</hi> and his Forces, the loſs of his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:199140:125"/> Friends, bereavement of his dear Wife and beloved Son, whom in his haſte he was forced to leave Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to ſave his own life, his Treaſurers taken, and his own Followers Plotting againſt his life, Divine Vengeance overtook him for cauſeleſly breaking his League. For having been Hunting like a Savage Beaſt through the Woods, about a hundred Miles backwards and forwards, at laſt he was driven to his own Den upon Mount <hi>Hope,</hi> retiring himſelf, with a few of his beſt Friends, in a <hi>Swamp,</hi> which proved now a Priſon to ſecure him 'till the Meſſenger of death came.</p>
               <p>For ſuch was his hatred againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that he could not hear any thing ſhould be ſuggeſted to him about Peace, inſomuch that he cauſed one of his Confederates to be kill'd for propounding it; which ſo provoked ſome of his Company, not altogether ſo deſperate as himſelf, that one of them (that was near Kin to him that was killed) fled to <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> and informed Captain <hi>Church</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> was, offering to lead him thither: Upon this welcome news, a ſmall Party of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> came very early in the Morning and ſurrounded his Swamp, from whence (as he was endeavouring to make his eſcape) he was ſhot through the Heart by an <hi>Indian</hi> of his own Nation; for Capt. <hi>Church</hi> having appointed an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> to ſtand at ſuch a place of the Swamp, where it happen'd that <hi>Philip</hi> was breaking through; the Morning being very wet and rainy, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Gun would not fire; the <hi>Indian</hi> having an old Musket, with a large Touch-hole, it took fire the more readily; which when <hi>Philip</hi> was diſpatch'd, the Bullet paſſing directly through his heart, ſoon after ſeveral of his Confederates and Counſellors were taken, and ſuffered deſerved
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:199140:125"/> puniſhment, and in a ſhort time moſt of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers received their condign rewards. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogether impertinent, but may diſcover much of the temper and management of the <hi>Indians</hi> in this War, to inſert an account of one <hi>Stockwell,</hi> of <hi>Deerfield,</hi> concerning his Captivity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, with other notable occurrences during his continuance among them, written with his own Hand, and are as follow in his own Words, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> 19. 1677. About Sun-ſet, I and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man being together, the <hi>Indians</hi> with great ſhouting and ſhooting came upon us, and ſome other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hard by, at which we ran to a Swamp for refuge; which they perceiving, made after us, and ſhot at us, three Guns being diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon me; the Swamp being mine, I ſlipt in, and fell down; whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtept to me, with his Hatchet lifted up to knock me on the head, ſuppoſing I was wounded, and unfit for Travel: It happened I had a Piſtol in my Pocket, which (though uncharged) I preſented to him, who preſently ſtept back, and told me, if I would yield I ſhould have no hurt, boaſting falſely, that they had deſtroyed all <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and that the Woods were full of <hi>Indians;</hi> whereupon I yielded myſelf, and fell into the Enemies Hands, and by three of them was led away to the place whence I firſt fled; where two other <hi>Indians</hi> came running to us, and one lifting up the But-end of his Gun to knock me on the head, the other with his hand put by the blow, and ſaid I was his Friend. I was now near my own Houſe, which the <hi>Indians</hi> burnt laſt year, and I was about to build up again, and there I had ſome hopes to eſcape from them; there was a Horſe juſt by, which they bid me take, I did ſo, but attempted no eſcape, becauſe the Beaſt was
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:199140:126"/> dull and ſlow, and I thought they would ſend me to take my own Horſes; which they did, but they were ſo frighted, that I could not come near them, and ſo fell again into the Enemies Hands, who now took me, bound me, and led me away. Soon after, I was brought to other Captives, who were that day taken at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> which moved two contrary Paſſions, Joy, to have Company; and Sorrow, that we were in that miſerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: We were all pinion'd and led away in the Night over the Mountains, in dark and hideous ways, about four Miles further, before we took up our place of reſt, which was a diſmal place of a Wood on the Eaſt-ſide of that Mountain; we were kept bound all that night, the <hi>Indians</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, who, as they Travell'd, made ſtrange noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as of Wolves, Owls, and other Birds and Beaſts, that they might not loſe one another; and if followed, might not be diſcover'd by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About break of day we marched again, and got over the great River <hi>Pecompt uck;</hi> there the <hi>Indians</hi> marched out upon Trays, the number of their Captives and Slain, as there manner is: Here I was again in great dange0r, a quarrel ariſing whoſe Captive I was, and I was afraid I muſt be killed to end the controverſie; they then asked me whoſe I was, I ſaid three <hi>Indians</hi> took me; ſo they agreed to have all a ſhare in me: I had now three Maſters, but the Chief was he that firſt laid hands on me, which happened to be the worſt of the company, as <hi>Aſhpelon</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Captain told me, who was always very kind to me, and a great comfort to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> In this place they gave us Victuals which they had brought away from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ten Men were again ſent out for more
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:199140:126"/> Plunder, ſome of whom brought Proviſion, others Corn out of the Meadows, upon Horſes; from hence we went up above the Falls, where we croſt that River again, when I fell down-right Lame of my old Wounds received in the War; but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of being killed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and what cruel death they would put me to, ſoon frighted away my pain, and I was very brisk again. We had eleven Horſes in that company? which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Burthens and the Women; we travell'd up the River till night, and then took up our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in a diſmal place, being laid on our Backs and ſtaked down, in which poſture we lay many nights together; the manner was, our arms and legs being ſtretched out, were ſtaked faſt down, and a Cord put about our necks, ſo that we could not poſſibly ſtir; the firſt night (being much tired) I ſlept as comfortably as ever; the next we lay in the <hi>Saquahog</hi>-Meadows; our Proviſion was ſoon ſpent, and whilſt we were there, the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army came out after us. Then the <hi>Indians</hi> moved again, dividing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Captives into many companies, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might not follow their Track; at night, having croſſed the River, we met again at the place appointed; the next day were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, where we continued a long time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about thirty Miles above <hi>Squag,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> were quite out of fear of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but much afraid of the <hi>Mo-hawks,</hi> another ſort of <hi>Indians,</hi> Enemies to them.</p>
               <p>In this place they built a ſtrong <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and had a great Daunce, as they call'd it, where it was concluded to burn three of us; having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Bark for that purpoſe, of whom (as I heard afterwards) I was to be one, Serjeant <hi>Plumpton</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:199140:127"/> another, and the Wife of <hi>Benjamin Wait</hi> the third; I knew not then who they were, yet I underſtood ſo much of their Language, that I perceived ſome were deſigned thereto; that night I could not ſleep for fear of the next day's work, the <hi>Indians</hi> (weary with dancing) lay down and ſtept ſoundly. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were all looſe, whereupon I went out for Wood, and mended the fire, making a noiſe on purpoſe, but none awaked; I thought if any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould wake, we might kill them all ſleeping; to which end I removed out of the way all the Guns and Hatchets, but my heart failing, I put all things where they were again. The next day (when they intended to burn us) our Maſter and ſome others ſpoke for us, and the evil was prevented at this time: We lay here about three Weeks, where I had a Shirt brought me to make; one <hi>Indian</hi> ſaid it ſhould be made this way, another a different way, and a third this way, whereupon I told them I would make it according to my chief Maſter's order; upon this an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtruck me on the face with his fiſt, I ſuddenly roſe in anger to return it again, which raiſed a great Hubbub; the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming about me, I was fain to humble my ſelf to my Maſter, which ended the matter. Before I came to this place, my three Maſters were gone a Hunting, and I was left with only one <hi>Indian</hi> (all the company being upon a march) who fell ſick, ſo that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hatchet, whereby I had opportunity to have diſpatched him, but did not, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Captives had engag'd the contrary to each other, ſince if one ſhould run away, it would much endanger the remainder: Whilſt we were here, <hi>Benjamin Stebbins,</hi> going with ſome <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Wachuſet</hi> Hills, made his eſcape, the tydings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:199140:127"/> cauſed us all to be called in and bound. One of the <hi>Indians</hi> Captains, and always our great Friend, met me coming in, and told me <hi>Stebbins</hi> was run away, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſpoke of burning us; ſome were only for burning our fingers, and then biting them off; he ſaid there would be a Court, and all would ſpeak their minds, but he would ſpeak laſt, and declare, That the <hi>Indian,</hi> who ſuffered <hi>Stebbins</hi> to make his eſcape, was only in fault; and bid us not fear any hurt ſhould happen to us, and ſo it prov'd accordingly.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we lingered here-about, Proviſion grew ſcarce, one Bear's Foot muſt ſerve five of us a whole day; we began to eat Horſe-fleſh, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured ſeveral Horſes, three only being left alive. At this time the <hi>Indians</hi> had fallen upon <hi>Hadley,</hi> where ſome of them being taken, were releaſed, upon promiſe of meeting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on ſuch a Plain, to make further Terms: Captain <hi>Aſhpalon</hi> was much for it, but the <hi>Sachins</hi> of <hi>Wachuſet,</hi> when they came, were againſt it; yet were willing to meet the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> only to fall upon and deſtroy them. <hi>Aſhpalon</hi> charged us <hi>Engliſh</hi> not to ſpeak a word of this, ſince miſchief would come of it. With theſe <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Wachuſet,</hi> there came above fourſcore <hi>Squaws,</hi> or Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who reported the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had taken <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> and all his Men, and ſent them beyond the Seas; whereat they were much enraged, asking us if it were true; we deny'd it, which made <hi>Aſhpalon</hi> angry, ſaying he would no more believe <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> They then examin'd every one apart, and dealt worſe with us for a time, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſtill Proviſion was ſcarce; at length we came to a place called <hi>Squaro-Maug-River,</hi> where we hoped to find Salmon, but came too late; this
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:199140:128"/> place I reckon two hundred Miles above <hi>Deer-field,</hi> then we parted into two companies, ſome went one way, and ſome another; we paſſed over a mighty Mountain, being eight days in travelling of it, though we marched very hard, and had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day either Snow or Rain; we obſerved that on this Mountain all the Water ran Northward. Here we likewiſe wanted Proviſion, at length we got over and came near a Lake, where we ſtaid a great while to make <hi>Canoes,</hi> wherein to paſs over. Here I was frozen, and here again we were like to ſtarve; all the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting, but could get nothing ſeveral days; they <hi>Pawawed,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, but to no purpoſe; then they deſired the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to pray, confeſſing they could do nothing, and would have us try what the <hi>Engliſhmans</hi> God could do: I prayed, ſo did Serjeant <hi>Plumpton</hi> in another place, the <hi>Indians</hi> reverently attending Morning and Night; next day they killed ſome Bears, then they would needs make us deſire a Bleſſing, and return Thanks at Meals; but after a while they grew weary of it, and the <hi>Sachim</hi> forbid us; when I was frozen, they were very cruel to me, becauſe I could not do as at other times.</p>
               <p>When we came to the Lake, we were again ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtreightned for Proviſion, and forced to eat Touch-wood fried in Bear's Greaſe; at laſt we found a company of <hi>Racoons,</hi> and then we made a Feaſt, the Cuſtom being that we muſt eat all; I perceived I had too much for one time, which an <hi>Indian</hi> that ſate by obſerving, bid me to ſlip away ſome to him under his Coat, and he would hide it for me till another time; this <hi>Indian,</hi> as ſoon as he had got my meat, ſtood up and made a Speech to the reſt, diſcovering what I had done, whereat
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:199140:128"/> they were very angry, and cut me another piece, forcing me to drink <hi>Racoons</hi> Greaſe, which made me ſick and vomit; I told them I had enough, after which they would give me no more, but ſtill told me I had <hi>Racoon</hi> enough, whereby I ſuffered much, and (being frozen) was in great pain, ſleeping but little, and yet muſt do my task that was ſet me; as they came to the Lake, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great <hi>Mooſe,</hi> ſtaying there till it was all eaten, and then entered upon the Lake; a Storm aroſe, which endangered us all, but at laſt we got to an Iſland, and there the <hi>Indians</hi> went to <hi>Pawawing,</hi> or Conjuring; the <hi>Pawaw</hi> declared, that <hi>Bejamin Wait</hi> and another were coming, and that Storm was raiſed to caſt them away: This afterwards appeared to be true, though then I believed it not; upon this Iſland we lay ſtill ſeveral days, and then ſet out again, but a Storm took us, ſo that we continued to and fro upon certain Iſlands about three weeks; we had no Proviſions but <hi>Racoons,</hi> that the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves were afraid of being ſtarved; they would give me nothing, whereby I was ſeveral days without any Victuals: At length we went upon the Lake on the Ice, having a little Slead, upon which we drew our Loads; before Noon I tired, and juſt then the <hi>Indians</hi> met with ſome <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> One of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who took me, came and called me all manner of ill Names, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me on my back; I told him I could do no more, then he ſaid he muſt kill me, which I thought he was about to do, for pulling out his knife, he cut off my Pockets and wrapt them about my Face, and then he helped me up, and took my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lead and went away, giving me a bit of Bisket like a <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,</hi> which he had of the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and told me he would give me a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco;</hi> when my
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:199140:129"/> Slead was gone, I ran after him, (but being tired) ſoon fell to a foot-pace, whereby the <hi>Indians</hi> were out of ſight; I followed as well as I could, having many falls upon the Ice; at length I was ſo ſpent, I had not ſtrength enough to riſe again, but crept to a Tree that lay along, upon which I continued all the cold night, it being very ſharp weather.</p>
               <p>I now counted no other but I muſt here die, which whilſt I was ruminating of, an <hi>Indian</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and I anſwered; he came to me and called me bad Names, telling me if I would not go, he muſt knock me on the head; I told him he muſt then do ſo, he ſaw how I had wallowed in the Snow, but could not riſe, hereupon he wrapt me in his Coat, and going back, ſent two <hi>Indians</hi> with a Slead; one ſaid he muſt knock me on the head, the other ſaid no, they would carry me away and burn me; then they bid me ſtir my Inſtep, to ſee if that were frozen, I did ſo; when they ſaw that, they ſaid there was a Chirurgeon with the <hi>French</hi> that could cure me; then they took me upon a Slead and carried me to the fire, making much of me, pulling of my wet, and wrapping me in dry Cloaths, laying me on a good Bed, they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Otter,</hi> and gave me ſome of the Broth, and a bit of the Fleſh; here I ſlept till towards day, and was then able to get up and put on my Cloaths; one of the <hi>Indians</hi> awaked, and ſeeing me go, ſhouted, as rejoycing at it. Aſſoon as it was light, I and <hi>Samuel Ruſſel</hi> went afore on the Ice upon a River, they ſaid I muſt go on foot as much as I could for fear of freezing; <hi>Ruſſul</hi> ſlipt into the River with one foot, the <hi>Indians</hi> called him back and dried his Stockins, and ſent us away with an <hi>Indian</hi> Guide; we went four or five Miles before the reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> overtook us; I was pretty
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:199140:129"/> well ſpent, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſaid he was faint, and wondred how I could live, for he ſaid he had had ten Meals to my one; I was then laid on the Slead, and they ran away with me on the Ice; the reſt and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came ſoftly after, whoſe face I never after ſaw more, nor knew what become of him. About midnight we got near <hi>Shamblee,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Town, where the River was open; when I came to travel, I was not able, whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> who ſtaid with me would carry me a few Rods, and then I would go as many, telling me I would die if he did not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me, and I muſt tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> how kind he was.</p>
               <p>When vve came to the firſt houſe, there vvas no Inhabitants; the <hi>Indian</hi> and I were both ſpent and diſcouraged, he ſaid vve muſt novv both die; at laſt he left me alone, and got to another houſe, from vvhence came iomſ <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> vvho brought me in; the <hi>French</hi> vvere very kind, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my hands and feet in cold Water, and gave me a dram of Brandy, and a little Haſty-Pudding and Milk; vvhen I taſted Victuals, I vvas very hungry, but they vvould not ſuffer me to eat too much; I lay by the ſire vvith the <hi>Indians</hi> that night, yet could not ſleep for pain; next morning the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> fell out about me, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaying, that the <hi>French</hi> loved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> better than the <hi>Indians:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> preſently turned the <hi>Indians</hi> out of doors, being very careful of me, and all the Men in the Tovvn came to ſee me: Here I continued three or four days, and vvas invited f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Natives are of a very inconſtant, crafty and timorous diſpoſition, but are very ingenious and quick of apprehenſion, ſoon angry, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, that they ſeldom forget injury; and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly cruel, witneſs their direful revenge upon each other; prone to injurious violence and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both Men and Women being very theeviſh, and great haters of Strangers; all of them <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi> or Eaters of humane Fleſh ; and ſo were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Heathen <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who us'd to feed upon the Buttocks of Boys, and the Paps of Women.

               <p>Wives they have two or three, according to their ability and ſtrength of body; the Women have the eaſieſt labour of any in the World, for when their time is come, they go out alone, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Board with them two Foot long, and a Foot and an half broad, bored full of holes on each ſide, having a foot beneath, and on the top abroad ſtrap of Leather, which they put over their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Board hanging at their Back; when they come to a convenient Buſh or Tree, they lay them down, and are delivered in an inſtant, without ſo much as one groan; they wrap the Child up in young Beaver Skin, with his Heels cloſe to his Buttocks, and laced down to the Board upon his Back, his Knees reſting upon the foot beneath; then put the ſtrap of Leather upon their Forehead, with the Infant hanging at their Back, home they trudg, and dye the Child with a liquor of boil'd <hi>Hemlock-Bark,</hi> and then throw him into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if they ſuſpect it gotten by any other Nation; if it will ſwim, they acknowledg it for their own; they give them Names when they are Men grown, and love the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as <hi>Robbin, Harry, Philip,</hi> and the like; they are very indulgent to their Children, as well as Parents; but if they live ſo long as to be burthenſom, they either ſtarve or bury them alive, as it was ſuppoſed an <hi>Indian</hi> did by his Mother at <hi>Caſco,</hi> in 1669.</p>
               <p>Their Apparel,<note place="margin">Their Apparel</note> before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came among them, was the Skin of wild Beaſts, with the hair on; <hi>Buskins</hi> of Deer Skins, or <hi>Mooſe,</hi> dreſt, and drawn with lines into ſeveral works, the lines being coloured with yellow, blew or red; Pumps too they have, made of tough Skins, without ſoles. In the Winter, when Snow will bear them, they

Before the Meat was boyled, one took his Dog and Danced about the Kettles, and when he came before the <hi>Sagamore,</hi> threw the Dog down, and then another ſucceeded in the like Exerciſe: After the Feaſt, they Danced with the Heads of their Enemies in their hands, ſinging all the while. Their <hi>Canoes</hi> are of the Bark of <hi>Birch,</hi> ſtrengthned with little Wooden Hoops, they have many Fires in their Cabbins, ten Houſholds ſometimes live together, lying upon Skins one by another, and their Dogs with them, which are like <hi>Foxes.</hi> At another Feaſt, the Men cauſe all the Women and Maids to ſit in Ranks, themſelves ſtanding behind Singing; ſuddenly all the Women threw off all their Mantles of Skins, and ſtrip themſelves ſtark naked, being not at all aſhamed; their Songs ended, they cryed with one Voice, <hi>Ho, Ho, Ho,</hi> and then covered themſelves with their Mantles, and after a while renewed their former Songs? and Nakedneſs. When a Maid is fourteen or fifteen years of Age, ſhe hath many Lovers, and uſes her Pleaſure with as many of them as ſhe pleaſes, for five or ſix years, and then takes whom ſhe likes for a Husband, providing he be a good Hunter, living Chaſtly with him all her life after, except for Barrenneſs he forſakes her.</p>
               <p>When any dies, they make a Pit, and therein put all his Goods with the Corps, covering it over with Earth,<note place="margin">Their Iurials.</note> and ſetting many pieces of Wood over
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:199140:136"/> it, and a ſtake Painted red. They believe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, and that the Dead go into a far Country, to make merry with their Friends. If any fall ſick, they ſend to one <hi>Sagamon Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a great Conjurer, who made Prayers to the Devil, and blowed upon the Party, and cutting him, ſucks the Blood; if it be a Wound, he heals it after the ſame manner, applying a round ſlice of <hi>Beaver Stones,</hi> for which they make him a Preſent of <hi>Veniſon</hi> or <hi>Skins.</hi> If they deſire News of things abſent, the Spirit anſwers doubtfully, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falſe. When the <hi>Savages</hi> are hungry, they conſult with this Oracle, and he tells them the place where they ſhall go; if they find no Game, the excuſe is, the Beaſt hath wandered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his place, but moſt times they ſpeed, which makes them to believe the Devil to be God, though they do not Worſhip him. When theſe Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers conſult with the Devil, they fix a ſtaff in a Pit, to which they tie a Cord, and putting their Head into the Pit, make Invocation in an unknown Language, with ſo much ſtirring and pains, that they ſweat again; when the Devil is come, the Wizard perſuades them he holds him faſt with his Cord, forcing him to anſwer before he lets him go: Then he begins to ſing ſomething in praiſe of the Spirit, who hath diſcovered where there are ſome <hi>Deer,</hi> and the other <hi>Savages</hi> anſwer in the ſame Tune; they then Dance and Sing in a ſtrange Tongue: After which they make a Fire, and leap over it, putting an half Pole-out of the top of the Cabbin, wherein they are, with ſomething tied thereto, which the Devil carrieth away. <hi>Memberton</hi> wore about his neck the mark of his Profeſſion, which was a Triangle Purſe, with ſomething within it like a Nut, which he ſaid was his Spirit. This Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:199140:137"/> is Hereditary, they teaching this Myſtery of Iniquity to their Sons by Tradition.</p>
               <p>In 1613. fifty four <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> ſix Women, and two Children, Wintered there; they killed <hi>Bears, Otters</hi> and <hi>Sables,</hi> ſowed <hi>Wheat, Rye, Turnips</hi> and <hi>Coleworts.</hi> Their Winter was dry and clear, with ſome <hi>Froſt</hi> and <hi>Snow:</hi> Several had the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> againſt which, their <hi>Turnips</hi> proved a ſovereign Remedy.

               <p>Eaſt of <hi>New-found-land,</hi> over againſt <hi>Cape-Ray,</hi> at the diſtance of about 70 Miles from that Shore, lies a Bank or Ridge of Ground, extending about 300 Miles in length, and not above 75 in breadth, where broadeſt. This great Bank is covered with Water when the Sea is high, and uncovered and dry on the Ebb, on all ſides whereof the Sea is 200 fathom deep, ſo that ſhips of a conſiderable Burthen
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:199140:137"/> may ride over it. And about this Bank lies diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral ſmall Iſles, called by St. <hi>Sebaſtian Cabot</hi> (the firſt Diſcoverer) <hi>Los Boocaloos,</hi> or the Iſles of <hi>Cod-Fiſh,</hi> from that Prodigious quantities of <hi>Cod-fiſh</hi> there found, which were ſaid to obſtruct the paſſage of his Veſſels.</p>
               <p>It is almoſt incredible how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations yearly Trade thither,<note place="margin">Their Trade.</note> amounting to between three or four hundred Sayl of Ships, that are aſſured to find ſufficient Freight of <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Poor John,</hi> one man catching an hundred in an hour; they Fiſh with Hooks, which are no ſooner thrown into the Sea, but the greedy Fiſh ſnapping the Bait, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and drawn on Ship-board, where they lay him on a Plank, one cutting off his Head, another guts and takes out its biggeſt Bones, another ſalts and barrels it; which being thus ordered, is hence tranſported by the <hi>European</hi> Nations to all parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and through moſt other parts of the World: They fiſh only in the Day, the <hi>Cod</hi> not biting in the Night; nor doth the Fiſh laſt all Seaſons, but begins towards Spring, and ends in <hi>September;</hi> for in Winter they retire to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, where Storms and Tempeſts have no power.</p>
               <p>Near theſe Coaſts is another kind of Fiſhing for <hi>Cod,</hi> which the call Dried, as the other <hi>Green-Fiſh.</hi> The Fiſhermen retire into ſome Harbour, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Morning ſend out their Shallops two or three Leagues into the Sea, who fail not of their Load by Noon or ſoon after, which they bring to Land, and order as the other: After this Fiſh has lain ſome days in Salt, they take it out, and dry it in the Wind, laying it again in heaps, and expoſing it daily to the open Ayr till it be dry, which ought
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:199140:138"/> to be good and temperate, to make the Fiſh ſale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for Miſts moiſten it and make it rot, and the Sun cauſes yellowneſs.</p>
               <p>At this their Fiſhing, the Mariners have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the pleaſure of taking Fowl without going out of their Veſſels; for baiting their Hook, with the Cod's Livers, theſe Fowls are ſo greedy that they come by Flocks, and fight who ſhall get the Bait firſt, which ſoon proves its Death; and one being taken, the Hook is no ſooner thrown out, but another is inſtantly catcht.</p>
               <p>And were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> diligent to inſpect the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that might accrue to this Nation by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Plantations on the Iſland, and raiſe Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the ſecurity of the Place, we might give Laws to all Foreigners that come to Fiſh there, and in few years engroſs the whole Fiſhery to our ſelves; the greateſt Ballance perchance of Foreign Trade.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1623. Sir <hi>George Calvert</hi> Knight, and Principal Secretary of State, and afterwards Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> obtained a Patent of part of <hi>New-found-Land,</hi> which was erected into a Province, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Avalon;</hi> where he cauſed a Plantation to be ſetled, and a ſtately Houſe and Fort to be built at <hi>Ferryland,</hi> and afterwards tranſported himſelf and Family thither, and continued the Plantation by his Deputy, till by Deſcent (after his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Deceaſe) it came to his Son and Heir, the right Honourable <hi>Caecilius,</hi> now Lord <hi>Baltemore,</hi> who by Deputies from time to time was no leſs careful to preſerve his intereſt there; which tho' during the laſt Troubles in <hi>England,</hi> was by Sir <hi>David Kirk</hi>'s means, for ſome years diſcontinued; he was ſoon re-inveſted in the ſame by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt happy Reſtauration.</p>

               <p>It is a Countrey bleſt with a temperate and wholeſom Air,<note place="margin">Its Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> by reaſon of a warm and temperate heat; being moderated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Brieze of Wind; ſo that here is no Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſpent on purpoſe for Winter-proviſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the year long both Herbage and Fruit bud up by a perpetual Spring. And the Iſland is ſo well ſtored with Materials for Building, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you bring dextrous Hands, and good Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, you may in a ſhort time with little Charge, build both Houſes, Towns, and Fortifications.</p>
               <p>The Soyl doth naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Corn &amp; Grain.</note> ſuch as grows at <hi>Virginia, New-York, Carolina,</hi> &amp;c. But no <hi>Engliſh Grain</hi> grows here: however
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:199140:139"/> there are <hi>Engliſh Peaſe</hi> of divers ſorts, and <hi>Beans</hi> and <hi>Pulſe</hi> enough; likewiſe there is <hi>Guinea-Corn, Bonevis,</hi> the <hi>French-Pea,</hi> the <hi>Kidney-Pea,</hi> the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon-Pea,</hi> the <hi>French-Bean,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here are excellent Fruits in great abundance;<note place="margin">Its Fruits.</note> as, the <hi>Cuſhen-Apple,</hi> which are both Meat and Drink, only made diſtinguiſhable by the Art of Boyling; whoſe Nut if preſerved, you may eat, and of the Rinds while green, make an excellent Lamp-Oyl, which by ſmall Labour is eaſily obtained.</p>
               <p>Here is a Fruit called a <hi>Bonano,</hi> which may be eaten raw, or bettered by an eaſie decoction of Fire.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> ſuch as is that in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> and ſeveral parts in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then there is the <hi>Prickle-Apple,</hi> the <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> the <hi>Pine-Apple, Pome Citrons, Oranges</hi> of three ſorts; the ſower for Sawce, and the Flowers for Eſſences, the ſweet ones are eaten for Recreation.

               <p>Of <hi>Limons</hi> here are two ſorts; the ſower one for <hi>Limonadoes;</hi> and the ſweet one for Delectation.

There are various ſorts of <hi>Turtles;</hi> the <hi>Hawks-Bill,</hi> the <hi>Vandorus,</hi> the <hi>Loggerhead,</hi> and the <hi>green Turtle;</hi> which laſt the Natives think ſacred; for they call its <hi>Gods-fiſh,</hi> by reaſon of that extraordinary virtue that is found therein, it being found a very great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt Poyſon, and for the <hi>Gonorhaea,</hi> the <hi>Yaws,</hi> and the <hi>French Pox,</hi> there is not in nature a Food more effectual; ſhe lives in the Water, and without it, it ſwims like a Fiſh, and yet in the Sand lays Eggs like a Fowl; whoſe Fiſh is Fleſh, and admits of various taſtes, as, of Veal, of Beef, but the Fat is green, and eats like Marrow, and their Eggs undiſtinguiſhable from thoſe of a Hen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo there is <hi>Barracooto,</hi> and they are of two ſorts, and ſome about two foot in length, they have a long Beak or Snout filled full of Teeth.

This is the firſt Money laid out, nor need he be at any more Charge for in twelve Months time, he will have Ground-proviſion enough, and in all probability two Crops of <hi>Tobacco.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:199140:142"/>
                  <p>The next thing to conſider of, is the Improvement<note place="margin">Its Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of the ſaid Land, which is as followeth: After your arrival in the Iſland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> the firſt ſix Months may be ſpent to clear fifteen Acres of Land, and to put Proviſns into the Ground; to build Conveniencies to accommodate your ſelf and Family; to adapt and fit Ground for planting a Nurſery of <hi>Cacao-Nuts;</hi> as alſo a Bed ſowed with <hi>Tobacco-ſeeds,</hi> and be ſure to keep your Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery clear from Weeds: then, about a Months time after, you have ſown your <hi>Tobacco-ſeed,</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Seaſon be good) you may then draw your <hi>Tobacco-Plants,</hi> and plant them about ſome four foot diſtance one from another, regularly and in rows, which ſaid <hi>Tobacco, Tobago</hi> produces, is nothing inferiour to <hi>Spaniſh Trinidado,</hi> that lies about ſeven Leagues diſtance from the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> who ſell their <hi>Trinidado-Tobacco</hi> at the rate of Two Shillings a Pound, which ſaid <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tranſport from thence to <hi>Old Spain,</hi> and ſell it there for conſiderable advantage. Now among your <hi>Tobacco-Plants,</hi> you may plant your <hi>Cacao,</hi> and tranſplant them, when about ſix Months old, into new Ground, at ten or twelve foot diſtance, and be ſure to keep them clear from Weeds, in which latter ſix Months time, you may have on your cleared Ground two Crops of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</hi> Now admitting you make but Eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Weight of <hi>Neat Tobacco</hi> on the ſaid Ground, yet in all probability (provided your People be healthy) it may double the number to Sixteen thouſand. But if it do not, and put the caſe your <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſell but for an eighth part of what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſell for in <hi>Trinidado,</hi> (which is but three Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound, ſold here in our Iſland) yet will
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:199140:142"/> this Crop yield you One hundred Pound <hi>ſterling,</hi> which is your Money gained the very firſt Year, and in ſix Months time all Charges being born.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſe at the beginning of the ſecond Year, the ſaid ſixteen Acres be all cleared, and Proviſion enough put into the Ground, ſufficient for double your number of hands, you may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally then expect four Crops in twelve Months time, when as formerly you made two Crops in the laſt ſix Months; ſo that with the Hundred Pounds you gained laſt Year, you may now purchaſe ſeven or eight Slaves, or Servants, which may in all probability treble the firſt Year. But put the caſe, it but only double, yet at the worſt, it may yield you (and all Charges born) Two hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we cannot otherwiſe conclude, (if things ſucceed well) but the third Year will double the ſecond by improvement, as is above expreſſed; and if ſo, your Crop will amount to Four hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling,</hi> and the fourth Year double the third, by reaſon of the <hi>Cacao</hi> that was planted the firſt Year on the fifteen Acres of Land, may produce to the value of Thirty Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> an Acre, beſides the encreaſe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and clearing of more ground, together with your encreaſe of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ana Slaves, and planting of more <hi>Cacao-Trees,</hi> which at leaſt will ariſe to Eight hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> the fourth Year; the fifth Year, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, doubles the fourth Year; the ſixth Year you may very well clear Six thouſand Pounds <hi>ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and all Charges born, by reaſon the <hi>Cacao,</hi> planted the firſt Year, is now come to perfection, and at its full height of bearing; which in this Latitude may yield One hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> an Acre, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt fifteen Acres which were planted
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:199140:143"/> the firſt Year; and the ſecond years Plants, planted the ſecond Year, will yield you Sixty Pounds <hi>ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> and the third years Plants, as by the ſame Calculation, may yield you Thirty Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> an Acre: So that by purchaſing the more Servants and Slaves, you may, if you pleaſe, decline ſo much planting of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as formerly you did.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Year you will have all your Land planted with <hi>Cacao,</hi> and that increaſing, you need not plant above ten or fiften Acres of <hi>Tobacco</hi> this Year amongſt your <hi>Cacao;</hi> but you may plant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt them, for ſupport and maintenance of your ſelf and Family. So that from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of your ſeventh Year's Crop, you may hope and expect, by a modeſt computation, to clear from the ſaid fifty Acres of Land, at leaſt Five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> a Year.</p>
                  <p>And now we come to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for this great Improvement;<note place="margin">The Reaſons for Improvement.</note> You muſt conſider, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> in <hi>Trinidado,</hi> &amp;c. give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves One hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling,</hi> for a <hi>Negro</hi>-Slave, and yet the ſaid Slave will not ſtand his Maſter in one ſingle Penny at the Year's end for his purchaſe; and all the labour and ſervice the <hi>Spaniard</hi> imploys him in the Year about, is only in <hi>Cacao</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh-Tobacco,</hi> in this our Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>Now pray conſider, that we can have <hi>Negro</hi>-ſlaves brought and delivered to us at Fifteen Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> a head, by reaſon we have an open Trade, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> allows not of a free Trade. Where note, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pays Six-pence or more for every thing he wants, when we have the ſame for a ſingle Penny. That's one Reaſon.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:199140:143"/>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, The <hi>Spaniard</hi> cannot have any Tunnage for Goods from <hi>Old Spain</hi> to the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and home again, for leſs than Forty or Fifty Pounds <hi>ſterling per</hi> Tun; beſides, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties run very high: And we can have, Freight for Five or Six Pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, and no Duties from us to a tree Port. When therefore, to conſider and compute the Charge on either ſide, we profit by what we tranſport ſix to one; which makes the <hi>Spaniard</hi> generally ſo poor in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and we generally to flouriſh ſo much the more.</p>
                  <p>The third Reaſon is, That in a Ship of Three hundred Tun, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſeldom leſs than two hundred Men belonging to her, and the Wages each Man comes to at leaſt Fifty Shilling <hi>ſterling per</hi> Month, which, in the whole, amounts to Five hundred Pounds a Month, barely for Wages; then you are to conſider the Monthly Proviſions, to accommodate theſe Men, cannot come to leſs than One hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>ſterling;</hi> and Ten Months, at Six hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month, amounts to Six thouſand and five hundred Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> for Ten Months. Moreover, this Ship of Three hundred Tun, ſeldom carries leſs than Forty Pieces of Ordnance, which with their Proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by modeſt computation, takes up no leſs room than One hundred and fifty Tun; ſo that the Ship, in all probability, cannot bring home more than One hundred and fifty Tun of Merchants Goods, and the Freight of theſe Goods comes to Forty Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> a Tun, to pay Ware and Tare of the Ship and Mens Wages; ſo that for the Ship's Ware and Tare, it comes barely but to One hundred and fifty Pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> clear.</p>
                  <p>Now admit an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship of Three hundred Tun, be bound for <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and ſuppoſe the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:199140:144"/> Freight of this Ship be at Six Pounds <hi>ſterling per</hi> Tun, this Ship ſhall make her Voyage better in Eight Months time than the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhall in Ten Months; now the Freight of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship comes to One thouſand eight hundred Pounds <hi>ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and the Wages and Victuals of the ſaid Ship, at Sixty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month, comes to Four hundred and eighty Pounds <hi>ſterling;</hi> ſo that you ſee the Ship clears, for her Ware and Tare, the ſum of One thouſand three hundred and twenty Pounds <hi>ſterling.</hi> See here therefore the great difference.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt reaſon is this; The King of <hi>Spain</hi> contracts with a body of Merchants, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with Four thouſand <hi>Negroes</hi> every Year, and the <hi>Nigrilloes,</hi> or Merchants, there engage to pay the King one hundred Pieces of Eight Cuſtom for each <hi>Negro</hi>-ſlave brought unto them; which comes to Four hundred thouſand Pieces of Eight by the Year, which is paid to the ſaid King; the King therefore prohibits all Merchants and others, for bringing <hi>Negroes</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and each Piece of Eight is valued at Five Shillings <hi>ſterling</hi> in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> but in the <hi>Leeward Iſlands</hi> it goes for ſix.</p>

               <p>LET the Square in the Figure at the end of this Book, noted with A B C D, be the top of a Poſt (or other level Plain or Window) upon which you would ſix your Dial.</p>
               <p>About the middle thereof, as at O, deſcribe a Circle, as E G F, and upon O (the Centre) erect a ſmall Pyn or Wire, as O S, exactly perpendicular, and in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon obſerve when the point of the ſhadow of the top of the Pyn or Wire touches the Circle, which ſuppoſe to be at the point E, (which point mark.) Then again (in the Afternoon of the ſame day) obſerve when the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow touches the ſame Circle, (which (in the Afternoon) let be at the point F.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Obſervations being made, divide the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle between E and F, into two equal parts, which will be at G; ſo a line drawn from G through O (as the line G O H) ſhall be a true Meridian line; upon which the Hour line of XII of your Dial muſt be placed, and the Dial ſo fixed, (truly Horizontal) ſhall conſtantly give you the true Hour.</p>
               <p>You may make more Circles than one upon the Plain, leſt the Sun upon the ſame day ſhould not be ſeen exactly at the ſame time of both parts of the day, as the Figure plainly ſhews.</p>
